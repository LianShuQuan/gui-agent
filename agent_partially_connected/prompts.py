## Overall task:

{current_subtask_description}

You are required to use `pyautogui` to perform the action grounded to the observation, but DONOT use the `pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen` function to locate the element you want to operate with since we have no image of the element you want to operate with. DONOT USE `pyautogui.screenshot()` to make screenshot.
Return one line or multiple lines of python code to perform the action each time, be time efficient. When predicting multiple lines of code, make some small sleep like `time.sleep(0.5);` interval so that the machine could take; Each time you need to predict a complete code, no variables or function can be shared from history
You need to to specify the coordinates of by yourself based on your observation of current observation, but you should be careful to ensure that the coordinates are correct.
You ONLY need to return the code inside a code block, like this:
```python
# your code here
```
Specially, it is also allowed to return the following special code:
When you think you have to wait for some time, return ```WAIT```;
When you think the task can not be done, return ```FAIL```, don't easily say ```FAIL```, try your best to do the task;
When you think the task is done, return ```DONE```.

RETURN ME THE CODE OR SPECIAL CODE I ASKED FOR. NEVER EVER RETURN ME ANYTHING ELSE.
