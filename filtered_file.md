When you use a computer app to create, edit, and format text documents, you are performing a task known as word processing. Word 2019 is one of the most sophisticated word-processing apps available. You can use Word to efficiently create a wide range of business and personal documents, from a simple letter to a complex report. Word includes many desktop publishing features that you can use to enhance the appearance of documents so that they are visually appealing and easy to read.  

The elements that control the appearance of Word and the way you interact with it while you create documents are collectively referred to as the user interface. Some user interface elements, such as the color scheme, are cosmetic. Others, such as toolbars, menus, and buttons, are functional. The default Word configuration and functionality is based on the way that most people work with the app. You can modify cosmetic and functional user interface elements to suit your preferences and working style.  

This chapter guides you through procedures related to starting Word, working in the Word user interface, and managing Office and app settings.  

# START WORD  

Office 2019 is engineered for Windows 10. You can start Word 2019 from the Start menu app list or tile area, the Start screen, or the taskbar search box. You might also have a shortcut to Word on your desktop or on the Windows taskbar.  

When you start Word without opening a specific document, the Word Home page appears. The Home page is a simplified hybrid of the Open and New pages of the Backstage view. It displays file templates and recent files that you might want to reopen. If you’re using Word as part of an Office 365 subscription, it displays files from all the Word instances linked to your account.

The Word Home page  

# Tip  

You can turn off the appearance of the Home page (also called the Start screen) if you want to go directly to a new, blank document. For information, see “Change default Word options” in Chapter 16, “Customize options and the user interface.”  

# To start Word by opening a document  

 In File Explorer, double-click the document.   
 In Microsoft Outlook, double-click a document attached to an email message.  

# Tip  

By default, Word opens documents from online sources in Protected View, which prevents editing and printing of the documents. To turn off Protected View, select Enable Editing on the information bar below the ribbon.  

# To start Word  

1. Select the Start button, and then select All apps. 2. In the app list, select any index letter to display the alphabet index, and then select W to scroll the app list to the apps starting with that letter. 3. Scroll the list if necessary, and then select Word to start the app.  

# WORK IN THE WORD USER INTERFACE  

The Word user interface provides intuitive access to all the tools you need to develop sophisticated documents tailored to the needs of your audience. You can use Word 2019 to do the following:  

 Create professional-looking documents that incorporate impressive graphics. Give documents a consistent look by applying styles and themes that control the font, size, color, and effects of text and the page background.   
 Store and reuse preformatted elements such as cover pages and sidebars. Create personalized mailings to multiple recipients without repetitive typing. Track reference information and compile tables of contents, indexes, and bibliographies. Find quotes, information sources, and images to support your document content.   
 Coauthor documents with team members. Safeguard documents by controlling who can make changes and the types of changes that can be made, and by removing personal and confidential information.  

When you’re working with a document, it is displayed in an app window that contains all the tools you need to add and format content.  

![](images/2343c4b583190001651cc5acec75c5edf91fb43c4dd65aa5fd0731065cc8f040.jpg)  

# Identify app window elements  

The Word app window contains the elements described in this section. Commands for tasks you perform often are readily available, and even those you might use only infrequently are easy to find.  

# Title bar  

Located at the top of the app window, the title bar displays the name of the active document and provides tools for managing the app window, ribbon, and content. If the document is stored online in OneDrive or SharePoint, a drop-down menu adjacent to the file name provides a simple way to change the file name and access the storage location and version history. Otherwise, the title bar displays the local storage location.  

![](images/0940d3c73bdfb27d11cdc7d0096b7ac6027462db94506420f97093c33f2ea89c.jpg)  
The title bar elements differ based on the file-storage location  

The Quick Access Toolbar is located, by default, at the left end of the title bar. (You can move it below the ribbon if you prefer.) You can customize it to include any commands that you want to have easily available. The default Quick Access Toolbar in the Word app window displays the Save, Undo, and Redo/Repeat buttons. If the file is stored online in SharePoint or OneDrive, it also includes the AutoSave toggle button, and on a touchscreen device, it includes the Touch/Mouse Mode button.  

![](images/99bbc8efdd4786cbe0676d98139fd6ac65f80598d470206d0ed8b10157e62fc7.jpg)  


# Tip  

You might find that you work more efficiently if you organize the commands you use frequently on the Quick Access Toolbar and then display it below the ribbon, directly above the workspace. For more information, see “Customize the Quick Access Toolbar” in Chapter 16, “Customize options and the user interface.”  

The four buttons at the right end of the title bar serve the same functions in all Office apps. You control the display of the ribbon by selecting commands on the Ribbon Display Options menu, temporarily hide the app window by selecting the Minimize button, adjust the size of the window by selecting the Restore Down/Maximize button, and close the active document or exit the app by selecting the Close button.  

![](images/221657a63ef375b994a946f1836cee3215915f6aad30d80e6358dc069077ce44.jpg)  


# The ribbon of commands  

Below the title bar, all the commands for working with a Word document are gathered together on the ribbon so you can work efficiently with the app. The ribbon is divided into tabs; each tab displays groups of commands. There are two types of tabs:  

Standard ribbon tabs These tabs are available regardless of the content you’re working with. The Home tab, which is active by default, contains the most frequently used commands. Other standard tabs contain commands specific to the type of action you want to perform, such as Insert, Draw, and Design.  

![](images/648e5fe23f55cc7002af7274f0eba378ad79ca7e5c339d48000605110b942ae2.jpg)  

The File tab leads to the Backstage view  

# Tip  

The available ribbon tabs and the appearance of commands on the ribbon might differ from what is shown in this book, based on the apps installed on your computer, the Word settings and window size, the screen settings, and whether your computer has a touchscreen. For more information, see the sidebar “Adapt procedures for your environment” later in this section.  

Object-specific tool tabs When a graphic element such as a picture, table, or chart is selected in a document, one or more tool tabs appear at the right end of the ribbon to make commands related to that specific object easily accessible. Tool tabs are available only when the relevant object is selected. They are differentiated from the standard tabs by color and a tab group name above the tab name.  

![](images/e7bdb75c8f8b5e79e9408033c0090bc170d8d9227d9cee6edd9d8a60895c8002.jpg)  
Typical tool tabs on the ribbon  

# Tip  

Some older commands no longer appear as buttons on the ribbon but are still available in Word. You can make these commands available by adding them to the Quick Access Toolbar or the ribbon. For more information, see “Customize the Quick Access Toolbar” and “Customize the ribbon” in Chapter 16, “Customize options and the user interface.”  

On each tab, buttons representing commands are organized into named groups. You can point to any button to display a ScreenTip that contains the command name, a description of its function, and its keyboard shortcut (if it has one).  

![](images/569daa7e9beb5b52d1946ed7fff51bd9d24da81c610a359284818dcd370e0d2f.jpg)  

ScreenTips can include the command name, keyboard shortcut, and description  

# Tip  

You can control the display of ScreenTips and of feature descriptions in ScreenTips. For more information, see “Change default Word options” in Chapter 16, “Customize options and the user interface.”  

Some buttons include an arrow, which might be integrated with or separate from the button. To determine whether a button and its arrow are integrated, point to the button. If both the button and its arrow become shaded, selecting the button displays options for refining the action of the button. If only the button or arrow becomes shaded when you point to it, selecting the button carries out its default action or applies the current default formatting. Selecting the arrow and then selecting an action carries out the action. Selecting the arrow and then selecting a formatting option applies the formatting and sets it as the default for the button.  

![](images/8163306c97991fc233e38ada56315e755469e2861a259ee670ab73b3668170d9.jpg)  
Examples of buttons with integrated and separate arrows  

When a formatting option has several choices available, they are often displayed in a gallery of images, called thumbnails, that provide a visual representation of each choice. When you select a block of content and then point to a thumbnail in a gallery, the Live Preview feature shows you what the selected content will look like if you select the thumbnail to apply the associated formatting. When a gallery contains more thumbnails than can be shown in the available ribbon space, you can display more thumbnails by selecting the scroll arrow or More button located on the right edge of the gallery. You can display the gallery in a separate floating pane by selecting the dialog box launcher.  

![](images/4b2a5d15822ec5e905bb64300ca4498c875e00a39a56cfcfe3507ae560ddadea.jpg)  

You can scroll the gallery content or expand it as a pane  

Related but less common commands are not represented as buttons in a group. Instead, they’re available in a dialog box or pane, which you open by selecting the dialog box launcher located in the lower-right corner of the group.  

# Tip  

To the right of the groups on the ribbon is the Collapse The Ribbon button, which is shaped like a chevron. For more information, see “Work with the ribbon and status bar,” later in this topic.  

# The Backstage view  

Commands related to managing Word and documents (rather than document content) are gathered together in the Backstage view, which you display by selecting the File tab located at the left end of the ribbon. Commands available in the Backstage view are organized on named pages, which you display by selecting the page tabs in the left pane. You redisplay the document and the ribbon by selecting the Back arrow located above the page tabs.  

![](images/614961482e851089663a4b8cce653f34bbf64a01812aa1afcdeddf38173db908.jpg)  

![](images/21a285dcc4146985405f042ed8a86929c73a92f3aed8a4c47814150653665b57.jpg)  

You manage documents and app settings in the Backstage view, which you display by selecting File on the ribbon  

# Collaboration tools  

If you’re using Word through an Office 365 subscription, commands related to collaboration appear below the window-management commands, at the right end of the ribbon. The available commands may include Share, Version History, Comments, and Feedback.  

![](images/d362a7ae8f9fd4885cf7ebeeea1d238d20567299c3aa0bcf9f5f42e6f09c5d66.jpg)  

The available collaboration tools vary based on the document storage location  

# Status bar  

Across the bottom of the app window, the status bar displays information about the current document and provides access to certain Word functions. You can choose  

# https://avxhm.se/blogs/hill0  

which statistics and tools appear on the status bar. Some items, such as Document Updates Available, appear on the status bar only when that condition is true.  

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="11"></td><td>CustomizeStatusBar</td></tr><tr><td>Formatted PageNumber</td></tr><tr><td>Section</td></tr><tr><td>PageNumber Page11of45</td></tr><tr><td>VerticalPagePosition</td></tr><tr><td>Line Number</td></tr><tr><td>Column</td></tr><tr><td>Word Count</td></tr><tr><td>CharacterCount(withspaces) 52124characters</td></tr><tr><td>SpellingandGrammarCheck Errors</td></tr><tr><td>Language English(United States) Signatures</td></tr><tr><td>Page11of45 9079words InformationManagementPolicy</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Permissions Off</td></tr><tr><td>TrackChanges On HO</td></tr><tr><td>CapsLock</td></tr><tr><td>Overtype</td></tr><tr><td>Selection Mode</td></tr><tr><td>Macro Recording NotRecording</td></tr><tr><td>Upload Status</td></tr><tr><td>This document hasbeen updated.To refresh the document,clickSave.</td></tr><tr><td>ViewShortcuts</td></tr><tr><td>Zoom Slider</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Zoom 80%</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# You can specify which items you want to display on the status bar  

The View Shortcuts toolbar, Zoom slider, and Zoom button are at the right end of the status bar. These tools provide you with convenient methods for changing the display of document content.  

![](images/38ba11d91bbdb0e4b16f507f4d65c0d0d96cb63b9d539bbfc23aa81f5f9d2a50.jpg)  

You can change the onscreen display of document content from the View Shortcuts toolbar  


# Work with the ribbon and status bar  

The goal of the ribbon is to make working with document content as intuitive as possible. The ribbon is dynamic, meaning that as its width changes, its buttons adapt to the available space. As a result, a button might be large or small, it might or might not have a label, or it might even change to an entry in a list.  

For example, when sufficient horizontal space is available, the buttons on the References tab of the Word app window are spread out, and you can review the commands available in each group.  

![](images/48448ad761411b0142afb7b372ce576032d693c949855fbd4a4b80402827834e.jpg)  

At 1152 pixels wide, most button labels are visible  

# Adapt procedures for your environment  

This book contains many images of the Word ribbon, app window, and other user interface elements that you’ll work with while performing tasks in Word on a Windows computer. Depending on your screen resolution, window width, or other installed apps, the Word ribbon on your screen might look different from what’s shown in this book. As a result, exercise instructions that involve the ribbon might require a little adaptation.  

Simple procedural instructions use this format:  

On the Insert tab, in the Illustrations group, select the Chart button.  

If the command is in a list, instructions use this format:  

On the Home tab, in the Editing group, select the Find arrow and then, in the Find list, select Go To.  

A procedure that has multiple simple methods of completion uses this format:  

On the Quick Access Toolbar, select Save.   
In the left pane of the Backstage view, select Save.   
Press $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{S}$ .  

If differences between your display settings and ours cause a button to appear differently on your screen than it does in this book, you can easily adapt the steps to locate the command. First select the specified tab, and then locate the specified group. If a group has been collapsed into a group list or under a group button, select the list or button to display the group’s commands. If you can’t immediately identify the button you want, point to likely candidates to display their names in ScreenTips.  

Multistep procedural instructions use this format:  

1. To select the paragraph that you want to format in columns, triple-click the paragraph.  

2. On the Layout tab, in the Page Setup group, select the Columns button to display a menu of column layout options.   
3. On the Columns menu, select Three.  

On subsequent instances of instructions that require you to follow the same process, the instructions might be simplified in this format because the working location has already been established:  

1. Select the paragraph that you want to format in columns.   
2. On the Columns menu, select Three.  

The instructions in this book assume that you’re interacting with onscreen elements on your computer by selecting or clicking them with a mouse, or on a touchpad or other hardware device. If you’re using a different method—for example, if your computer has a touchscreen interface and you’re tapping the screen (with your finger or a stylus)—substitute the applicable tapping action when the book directs you to select a user interface element.  

Instructions in this book refer to user interface elements that you select on the screen as buttons, and to physical buttons that you press on a keyboard as keys, to conform to the standard terminology used in documentation for these products.  

When the instructions tell you to enter information, you can do so by typing on a connected external keyboard, tapping an on-screen keyboard, or even speaking aloud, depending on your computer setup and your personal preferences.  

If you decrease the horizontal space available to the ribbon, small button labels disappear, large buttons change to small buttons, and entire groups of buttons might hide under one button that represents the entire group. Selecting the group button displays a list of the commands available in that group.  

![](images/e78109e4e8f43a04ce754cdcb869c84075ed07b071e515628960f6b2949bd0c7.jpg)  

When insufficient horizontal space is available, labels disappear and groups collapse under buttons  

When the ribbon becomes too narrow to display all the groups, a scroll arrow appears at its right end. Selecting the scroll arrow displays the hidden groups.  

![](images/9b63f8614de1f3cab28c9e341086915130dd489cc7b47ec23a11320d86c871c6.jpg)  

# Scroll to display additional group buttons  

The width of the ribbon depends on these three factors:  

 Window width Maximizing the app window provides the most space for the ribbon. Screen resolution Screen resolution is the size of your screen display expressed as pixels wide $\times$ pixels high. The greater the screen resolution, the greater the amount of information that will fit on one screen. Your screen resolution options depend on the display adapter installed in your computer, and on your monitor. Common screen resolutions range from $800\times600$ to $\mathbf{2560\times1440}$ (and some are larger). The greater the number of pixels wide (the first number), the greater the number of buttons that can be shown on the ribbon. The magnification of your screen display If you change the screen magnification setting in Windows, text and user interface elements are larger and therefore more legible, but fewer elements fit on the screen.  

You can hide the ribbon completely if you don’t need access to any of its buttons, or hide it so that only its tabs are visible. (This is a good way to gain vertical space when working on a smaller screen.) Then you can temporarily redisplay the ribbon to select a button, or permanently redisplay it if you need to select several buttons.  

If you’re working on a touchscreen device, you can turn on Touch mode, which provides more space between buttons on the ribbon and status bar. (It doesn’t affect the layout of dialog boxes or panes.) The extra space is intended to lessen the possibility of accidentally tapping the wrong button with your finger. The same commands are available in Touch mode as in Mouse mode (the standard desktop app user interface), but they’re sometimes hidden under group buttons.  

![](images/8b16091398d49f8381606580238fcd4621a073b91514dc098ccdeb0b5db5b8f5.jpg)  

Touch mode has a greater amount of space between Quick Access Toolbar, ribbon, Navigation pane, and status bar elements  


# To maximize the app window  

Select the Maximize button.   
 Double-click the title bar.   
 Drag the borders of a non-maximized window. Drag the window to the top of the screen. (When the pointer touches the top of the screen, the dragged window maximizes.)  

To change the screen resolution  

1. Do either of the following to open the Display pane of the System settings page: 1. Right-click the Windows 10 desktop, and then select Display settings 2. Enter screen resolution in Windows Search, and then in the search results, select Change the resolution of the display.   
2. In the Display pane, in the Resolution list, select the screen resolution you want. Windows displays a preview of the selected screen resolution.   
3. If you like the change, select Keep changes in the message box that appears. If you don’t, select Revert or wait for the screen resolution to automatically revert to the previous setting.  

# To change the magnification  

1. Do either of the following to open the Display pane of the System settings page:

3. When you finish, click away from the menu to close it.  

# MANAGE OFFICE AND APP SETTINGS  

You access app settings from the Backstage view; specifically, from the Account page and the Word Options dialog box.  

The Account page of the Backstage view in Word displays information about your installation of Word (and other apps in the Office suite) and the resources you connect to. This information includes:  

Your Microsoft account and links to manage it. The current app window background and theme. Storage locations and services (such as OneDrive and SharePoint) that you’ve connected Office to. Your subscription information and links to manage the subscription, if you have Office through an Office 365 subscription. The installed version and build number, update options, and links to information about Word and recent updates.  

![](images/68587226d3e9db7d180c6919d166214bcd0c869b457ed301d65cf55728effac8.jpg)  
Account information in Word  

# Microsoft account options  

If you use Office 365, Skype, OneDrive, Xbox Live, or Outlook.com, you already have a Microsoft account. (Microsoft account credentials are also used by many non-Microsoft products and websites.) If you don’t already have a Microsoft account, you can register any existing account as a Microsoft account, sign up for a free Outlook.com or Hotmail.com account and register that as a Microsoft account, or create an alias for an Outlook.com account and register the alias.  

TIP Many apps and websites authenticate transactions by using Microsoft account credentials. For that reason, it’s a good idea to register a personal account that you control, rather than a business account that your employer controls, as your Microsoft account. That way, you won’t risk losing access to your Microsoft account if you leave the company.  

Two ways you can personalize the appearance of your Word app window are by choosing an Office background and an Office theme. (These are specific to Office and aren’t associated with the Windows theme or desktop background.) The Office background is a subtle design that appears in the title bar of the app window. There are 14 backgrounds to choose from, or you can choose not to have a background.  

![](images/19f54e07c02a6b33da0106e4002c677b4a73529d413c0787b443d3c3e1b21dc1.jpg)  
Backgrounds depict a variety of subjects  

In addition to setting a background, you can set an Office theme. At the time of this writing, there are four Office themes:  

 Colorful This theme displays the title bar and ribbon tabs in a color specific to the app (blue for Word), and the ribbon commands, status bar, and Backstage view in light gray. Dark Gray This theme displays the title bar and ribbon tabs in dark gray, and the ribbon commands, status bar, and Backstage view in light gray. Black This theme displays the title bar, ribbon tabs, ribbon commands, and status bar in black and dark gray. White This theme displays the title bar, ribbon tabs, and ribbon commands in white, and the status bar in the app-specific color.  

# Tip  

The images in this book show the No Background option, to avoid interfering with the display of any user interface elements, and the Colorful theme.  

From the Connected Services area of the page, you can connect Word to YouTube accounts to access videos, and to SharePoint sites and OneDrive storage locations to share documents. You must already have an account with one of these services to connect Office to it.  

Until you connect to storage locations, they aren’t available to you from within Word. For example, when inserting a picture onto a page, you will have the option to insert a locally stored picture or to search online for a picture. After you connect to your SharePoint or OneDrive accounts, you can also insert pictures stored in those locations.  

The changes that you make on the Account page of Word apply to all the Office apps installed on all the computers associated with your Microsoft account. For example, changing the Office background in Word on one computer also changes it in Outlook on any other computer on which you’ve associated Office with the same account.  

Some of the settings on the Account page are also available in the Word Options dialog box, which you open from the Backstage view. This dialog box also contains hundreds of options for controlling the way Word works. Chapter 16, “Customize options and the user interface,” provides in-depth coverage of these options. It’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with the dialog box content so you know what you can modify.

# GET HELP AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK  

Word 2019 puts help at your fingertips, quite literally, and also makes it easy for you to express your opinions and make requests about app features.  

You can get information about a specific topic or command, or locate a person or file, by using the Tell Me feature that is conveniently located to the right of the ribbon tabs.

# The easy path to help in Word  

The new Help tab provides access to app information and training resources, as well as a way to contact the Microsoft Support team or submit feedback about your experience using Word. You can browse general information about Word, and find links to additional training resources, in the Help pane.  

![](images/123797a0971ffdfc059060ad9f608cedc0791c4300b11db7c863c5036ef9a94a.jpg)  

The Help pane displays online content from a variety of resources

Most Word Help content is stored online, so it isn’t available to you when you don’t have an internet connection.  

As you use Word and find things that work or don’t work for you, you can provide feedback directly to Microsoft from within the program. You can review and vote for existing feature requests, and add your own requests. This functionality has been available to early reviewers in the past but is now available to all Office users.

# KEY POINTS  

 Word has many user interface features in common with other Office apps. You can change the appearance and functionality of the Word user interface. Changes to the color scheme or app header image affect all Office apps on all computers linked to your user account. Information and training is available from the Help tab of the ribbon. Most help content is stored online, so it is not available to you when your computer or device is offline. You can send feedback and feature requests to the Office team, and review and vote for requests that other people have made.

5. If you have already found a feature that you like or dislike, display that feature or an example of it, and then send feedback that includes a screenshot.  

# CREATE DOCUMENTS  

All documents are based on templates. When you create a “blank document,” the document is based on the Normal template. You can create a blank document of the default file type or create a document based on a template, such as one of the templates provided with Word. Each template incorporates specific design elements such as fonts and colors. Many templates also include typical information that you can modify or build on to create a useful document.  

When you start Word, the app displays a Home page that gives you options for opening an existing file or creating a new one.  

![](images/7edc1be09c9da5c5489c49df4ef286da393691662f18592a2ac44ce1806a9587.jpg)  
The Home page appears by default but can be disabled  

# Tip  

The document templates that are available in Word include standard templates that have been available for many years, and featured templates that change occasionally. The templates on the New page of the Backstage view in your installation of Word might be different from those shown in images in this book.  

If you’re already working in Word, you can create a new document from the New page of the Backstage view. The same templates and search options are available from both the Home page and the New page.  

![](images/e1bcd33aec052648a70098b68c64564634bd0d808f0fe0c6394672991f6cc008.jpg)

# Word provides document templates for a wide variety of purposes  

If you create custom templates and save them in your Custom Office Templates folder, Featured and Personal links appear below the search box on the New page. You can click these links to switch between viewing app-supplied templates on the Featured page and your custom templates on the Personal page.  



# Tip  

Word 2019 template files have one of two file name extensions, depending on their content. Those that contain macros have the .dotm file name extension; those that don’t contain macros have the .dotx extension.  

When you base a new document on a template, that template is attached to the document. The styles defined in the attached template appear in the Styles pane so that you can easily apply them to any content you add to the document. You can change the document template by attaching a different one.  



# OPEN AND MOVE AROUND IN DOCUMENTS  

In addition to templates, the Home page displays documents you’ve worked in recently, documents you’ve pinned to the page so they’re always available, and documents other people have shared with you.  

# Open existing documents  

If the document you want to open appears on the Home page, you can open it directly from there. Otherwise, you can open documents stored locally on your computer or in a remote storage location such as a Microsoft OneDrive folder or a Microsoft SharePoint document library, either from within Word or from the document storage location.  

# Tip  

If you receive a document as an attachment to an email message, you can open the attached document and start Word, if it isn’t already running, from within Outlook 2019, or you can preview the document content directly in the Outlook Reading pane without starting Word.  

![](images/10832d71e2997b15402672583d0a7a91ea1903e7c61061bcd3af73d57db375d6.jpg)  
The Open page includes all the locations you’ve linked to from Office apps  

The Open page displays only documents saved in the Word-specific file formats (.docx and .doc) and templates created for those standards. For more information about file formats, see “Save and close documents” later in this chapter.  

The Recent list in the right pane of the Open page provides quick access to the documents you’ve worked with recently. The Recent list includes locally stored documents and documents that you’ve worked with while signed in with your current account on any computer, tablet, or other device, if the documents are stored in a shared location. This is one of the tremendous benefits of the Office 365 subscription model and the cloud storage that comes with it:you can be up and running on a new computer in minutes, without having to move files or configure settings and preferences. If you use multiple computers, you can use this very convenient feature to seamlessly transition between computers without having to actually transport files (on a USB flash drive or hard drive) or maintain multiple copies of files in different locations.  

![](images/8f18f288d4e4a5de046b50e1635da849bb157352cfdbb28042418922afc80605.jpg)  


# Tip  

In the Open dialog box, selecting a file name and then selecting the Open arrow displays a list of alternative ways to open the selected document. To look through a document without making any inadvertent changes, you can open the document as read-only, open an independent copy of the document, or open it in Protected View. You can also open the document in a web browser. In the event of a computer crash or other similar incident, you can tell the app to open the document and try to repair any damage.  

Open and edit PDF files in Word  

A useful feature of Word 2019 is the ability to open PDF files and edit them by using all the standard Word features. When you finish, you can save the file as a document or as a PDF.  

To open a PDF file in Word, do either of the following:  

In File Explorer, right-click the file, select Open with, and then select Word. In Word, display the Open page of the Backstage view, navigate to the file location, select the file, and then select Open. (In the Open dialog box, PDF files now fall into the category of Word Documents.)  

Word converts the file to an editable Word document. If the file contains complicated formatting and layout, the Word version of the document might not be a perfect replica of the PDF, but most simple files convert quite cleanly.  

# To open a file directly from a OneDrive storage site  

1. In your browser, navigate to the OneDrive folder.   
2. Browse to and select the file you want to open.   
3. If prompted to do so, enter the Microsoft account credentials associated with your OneDrive, and then select Sign in.  


# Move around in documents  

If you open a document that is too long or too wide to fit in the content pane, you can bring off-screen content into view without changing the location of the cursor by using the vertical and horizontal scroll bars. The scroll bars appear only when the document is longer or wider than the content pane. The scroll bars and pointer fade from sight when you’re not using the mouse, to remove distractions. You can make them reappear by moving the mouse.  

You can also move around in a document by moving the cursor. You can place the cursor in a specific location by clicking there, or you can move the cursor different distances and in different directions and by pressing keyboard keys.  

The cursor location is displayed on the status bar. By default, the status bar displays the page the cursor is on, but you can also display the cursor’s location by section, line number, and column, and in inches from the top of the page.  

![](images/8de42ac18f8f9f5b0b1479131588fe142f3b5afabfe0ea3fdcf29b08dff8ae79.jpg)

To show or hide the Navigation pane in a document  On the View tab, in the Show group, select the Navigation Pane check box.  

To browse by object from the Navigation pane  

Open the Navigation pane, and then do any of the following: At the top of the Navigation pane, select Headings. Then select any heading to move directly to that location in the document. At the top of the Navigation pane, select Pages. Then select any thumbnail to move directly to that page of the document. At the right end of the search box, select the arrow. In the Find list, select the type of object you want to browse by. Then select the Next and Previous arrows to move among those objects.  

To display the Go To tab of the Find And Replace dialog box  

On the Home tab, in the Editing group, select the Find arrow, and then Go To. In the Navigation pane, select the Search arrow, and then in the Search for more things list, select Go To.  Press $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{G}$ .  

To browse by object from the Go To What list  

1. Display the Go To tab of the Find and Replace dialog box.  

2. In the Go to what list, select the type of object you want to search for. Then do any of the following:  

1. Select the Next button to move to the next object of that type. 2. Select the Previous button to move to the previous object of that type. 3. In the adjacent box, enter either of the following, and then select the Go To button:  

1. Enter a number identifying the position of the object within the total objects of that type in the document. (For example, to move to the fourth field in the document, you would enter 4.) 2. Enter $^+$ (plus sign) or – (minus sign) and then a number to move forward or backward by that many objects of the selected type.  

# DISPLAY DIFFERENT VIEWS OF DOCUMENTS  

You can display a document in different views that provide different types of information and make it easier to interact with specific document elements. To take a closer look at the document content, you can increase the magnification of the content pane. If you want a high-level view of the content—for example, to quickly review all the pages of a document for length—you can decrease the magnification and view multiple pages at the same time.  

Word 2019 has five views in which you can create, organize, and preview documents. Each view is suited to a specific purpose. The views are:  

Print Layout This view displays a document on the screen the way it will look when printed. You can review elements such as margins, page breaks, headers and footers, and watermarks. This is the default view and the view you’ll use most frequently (or perhaps the only view you’ll use) when developing content. Read Mode This view displays as much document content as will fit on the screen at a comfortable size for reading. In this view, the ribbon is replaced by one toolbar at the top of the screen with buttons for searching and navigating in the document. You can display comments, but you can’t edit the document in this view. Web Layout This view displays the document the way it will look when viewed in a web browser, so that you can review the way that text wraps to fit the window and the positioning of graphics. Web Layout view also displays page backgrounds and effects.  

Outline This view displays the structure of a document as nested levels of headings and body text, and provides tools for viewing and changing the hierarchy.  

![](images/e99163ce7ac201d16a4f2536fe906f9e19d98f89a5181fdec9b80bf9c36146c1.jpg)  


# The junction of two pages with and without white space  

When working in Outline or Draft view, you can display the paragraph style of each paragraph in the left margin, in an area called the style area pane. (It’s not a pane, though; it’s just a marginal area of the page.) By default, the style area pane width is set to zero inches wide, so it is effectively closed. If you want to display it, you can increase the width.  

Style area pane set to1  

![](images/ac796c86602355857e43f867e41779d1d9fadb841ebb6f195ccd2e6e993a1e55.jpg)  

# The style area pane is available only in Draft view and Outline view  

If your document uses styles to control the appearance and hierarchy of the content, you can display the headings in the Navigation pane and styles in the Style pane so that you can more quickly access and work with styles and styled content. You can also use the Navigation pane to display and move among page thumbnails or search results, as described in the previous topic.  

Word has many other task-specific panes in which you can, for example, display Clipboard content, research terminology, review spelling, and format graphics. These panes usually appear to the right or left of the content pane and span its full height. Some of them can float within or outside the Word window or be docked to other sides of the window. Other chapters discuss these panes in the context of their functionality. Regardless of the purpose of the pane, however, you use the same methods to resize or move it.  

You can change the space available for document content and app window elements by resizing the window, adjusting the relative sizes of the panes, or collapsing or hiding the ribbon. You can also entirely hide not only the ribbon content, but also the ribbon tabs and the app window title bar.  

![](images/08c89a72231d27c55d9c02149b77238726e703c87fb8c838ee4e9dce93c55e23.jpg)  



# To adjust the size of the Navigation pane  

Point to the right border of the Navigation pane. When the pointer changes to a double-headed arrow, drag to the right or left.  

The Navigation pane is available in all views except Read Mode. When you adjust the width of the Navigation pane, the pane content changes accordingly. For example, the Navigation pane displays more page thumbnails in a narrow pane and fewer page thumbnails in a wide pane.  

To display the style area pane in Draft view or Outline view  

1. In the Backstage view, select the Options page tab to open the Word Options dialog box.   
2. In the Word Options dialog box, select the Advanced page tab.   
3. On the Advanced page, scroll to the Display area (about halfway down the page) and change the Style area pane width in Draft and Outline views setting to any number greater than 0. Then select OK.  

To resize the style area pane in Draft view or Outline view  

1. Point to the right border of the style area pane.   
2. When the pointer changes to a double-headed arrow, drag the border to the left or right.  

To change the magnification of document content  

1. Do either of the following to open the Zoom dialog box: 1. On the View tab, in the Zoom group, select Zoom. 2. At the right end of the status bar, select the Zoom Level button.   
2. In the Zoom dialog box, select a Zoom to option or enter a specific percentage in the Percent box, and then select OK.  


# Tip  

You need to hold down the Shift key to activate the \* key. So, in effect, you are pressing $\mathrm{Ctrl}{+}\mathrm{Shift}{+}8$ .  

To split a window into two panes  

On the View tab, in the Window group, select Split.  

To display a different open document  

On the View tab, in the Window group, select Switch Windows, and then select the file you want to view.   
Point to the Word icon on the Windows taskbar, and then select the   
thumbnail of the document you want to display.  

To display multiple open documents at the same time  On the View tab, in the Window group, select Arrange All.  

# DISPLAY AND EDIT FILE PROPERTIES  

Properties are file attributes or settings, such as the file name, size, creation date, author, and read-only status. Some properties exist to provide information to computer operating systems and apps. You can display properties within the content of a document (for example, you can display the page number on the document pages). Word automatically tracks some of the file properties for you, and you can set others.  

You can examine the properties attached to a file from the Info page of the Backstage view.  

![](images/33d066ed4c5bab7da091a8667207441dd446b62ef3ff496bf85a99fa52768b23.jpg)  
Some of the properties stored with a typical Word document  

You can change or remove basic properties in the default Properties list or expand the list to make more properties available, or you can display the Properties dialog box to access even more properties.  

# To display file properties  

1. Display the Info page of the Backstage view. The Properties area in the right pane displays the standard properties associated with the document.   
2. At the bottom of the Properties pane, select Show All Properties to expand the pane.   
3. At the top of the Properties pane, select Properties, and then select Advanced Properties to open the Properties dialog box.  

# To edit file properties  

1. In the Properties pane, select the value for the property you want to edit to activate the content box. 2. Enter or replace the property value, and then press Enter.  


# SAVE AND CLOSE DOCUMENTS  

When you save a document in Word, it is saved in the default .docx file format, but you can also select a different format from many other choices. For example, if you plan to distribute the document electronically to people who use a different wordprocessing program, you can choose a compatible format, or if you want to protect the document content, you can save it as a PDF file.  

# Manually save documents  

You save a document the first time by selecting the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar or by displaying the Backstage view and then selecting Save As. Both actions open the Save As page, where you can select a storage location.  

![](images/6eadf92479b23dfc1dd3f9703a09de8033434080b1b97cc0528cfe0c1a0416be.jpg)  
Save your document in an online location to access it from anywhere  

You can save the document in a folder on your computer or, if you have an internet connection, in a folder on your OneDrive. If your company uses SharePoint, you can add a SharePoint site so that it is available from the location list on the Save As page, just like any other folder.

If you want to create a new folder in which to store the document, select New Folder on the dialog box toolbar.  

After you save a document for the first time, you can save changes simply by selecting the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar. A new version of the document then overwrites the previous version.  

# To save a document for the first time  

1. Select the File tab to display the Backstage view.   
2. In the left pane of the Backstage view, select Save As.   
3. On the Save As page of the Backstage view, select a storage location, and then select a recently accessed folder in the right pane, or select Browse.   
4. In the Save As dialog box, browse to the folder you want to save the document in.   
5. In the File name box, enter a name for the document.   
6. If you want to save the document in a format other than the one shown in the Save As Type box, select the Save as type arrow and then, in the Save as type list, select the file format you want.   
7. In the Save As dialog box, select Save.  

To add a cloud storage location  

1. On the Save As page of the Backstage view, select Add a Place.   
2. In the Add a Place list, select Office 365 SharePoint or OneDrive.   
3. In the Add a service dialog box, enter the email address you use to sign in to the cloud storage service, and then select Next.   
4. In the Sign in dialog box, enter the password associated with the account, and then select Sign In to add the cloud storage location associated with that account to the Places list.  

To save a copy of a document  

1. Display the Save As page of the Backstage view.   
2. Save the document with a different name in the same location or with any name in a different location. (You can’t store two documents with the same name in the same folder.)  

To save a document without changing its name or location  

On the Quick Access Toolbar, select the Save button.   
In the left pane of the Backstage view, select Save.   
Press $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{S}$ .  

# Automatically save documents  

By default, Word automatically saves the document you’re working on and tracks saved versions so that you can gracefully recover documents without losing data, or you can revert to an earlier version.  

A new feature in Word automatically saves new versions of documents stored on SharePoint or OneDrive; these files have an AutoSave button on the Quick Access Toolbar that you can use to toggle the function off and on.  

When the AutoSave function is turned on:  

If you’re working in a new, unnamed file, the app saves a temporary copy of the file to your default storage location.   
If you’re working in a previously saved file, the app saves a copy of the file to the location in which you opened or last saved it.  

You can turn off the automatic file-saving function if you prefer to save changes manually (although this is not advisable), and you can change the time interval between saves.  

# To adjust the time interval between saves  

1. Display the Backstage view, and then select Options to open the Word Options dialog box.  

2. In the left pane, select Save.  

3. On the Save page, in the Save AutoRecover information every box, specify the frequency (in minutes) at which you’d like Word to save the document.  


# Save files to OneDrive  

When you save a document to OneDrive, you and other people with whom you share the document can work on it by using a local installation of Word or by using Word Online, which is available in the OneDrive environment. If you’re new to the world of OneDrive, here’s a quick tutorial to help you get started.  

OneDrive is a cloud-based storage solution. The purpose of OneDrive is to provide a single place for you to store and access all your files. Although this might seem like a simple concept, it provides major value for people who use Word or other Office products on multiple devices, including Windows computers, Mac computers, iPads and other tablets, and Windows, iPhone, and Android smartphones.  

For example, you can create a document on your desktop computer at work, edit it on your laptop at home, and review it on your smartphone while you’re waiting for your lunch to be served at a restaurant. If you use the full suite of Office products within your organization, you can even present the document in a Skype for Business meeting from your tablet PC, all while the document is stored in the same central location.  

There are currently two types of OneDrive—one for personal use and one for business use:  

OneDrive This personal OneDrive storage site is provided free with every Microsoft account. Each OneDrive is linked to a specific account.   
OneDrive for Business An organizational OneDrive storage site is provided with every business-level Office 365 subscription license. These storage locations are part of an organization’s Office 365 online infrastructure.  

You might have both types of OneDrive available to you. If you do, you can connect to both from within Word (or any Office app).  

In this book, the personal and organizational versions are referred to generically as OneDrive sites.  

To make OneDrive a realistic one-stop storage solution, Microsoft has chosen to support the storage of very large files (up to 10 gigabytes [GB] each) and to provide a significant amount of storage—from 5 GB to 1 terabyte (TB) per user, depending on your account type.  

By default, documents that you store on your OneDrive site are password-protected and available only to you. You can share specific files or folders with other people by sending a personalized invitation or a generic link that allows recipients to view or edit files. You can access documents stored on your OneDrive in several ways:  

From within Word when opening or saving a file.   
Through File Explorer, when you synchronize your OneDrive site contents with the computer.   
Through a web browser. Personal OneDrive sites are available   
at https://onedrive.live.com; organizational OneDrive for Business sites have  

addresses linked to your Office 365 business account, such as https://contosomy.sharepoint.com/personal/joan_contoso_com/.  

Because OneDrive and OneDrive for Business file storage locations are easy to add to any version of Word, OneDrive is a simple and useful cloud storage option.  

# Save documents in other formats  

Word 2019 uses file formats based on a programming language called Extensible Markup Language, or more commonly, XML. These file formats, called the Microsoft Office Open XML Formats, were introduced with Microsoft Office 2007.  

Word 2019 offers a selection of file formats intended to provide specific benefits. Each file format has a file name extension that identifies the file type to the system. The file formats and file name extensions for Word 2019 files include the following:  

Word Document (.docx)   
Word Macro-Enabled Document (.docm)   
Word Template (.dotx)   
Word Macro-Enabled Template (.dotm)   
Word XML Document (.xml)  

Other file types not specific to Word, such as text files, webpages, PDF files, and XPS files, are available from the Save As dialog box.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>File name:</td><td>WelcometoWord.docx</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Save astype:</td><td>Word Document(*.docx)</td></tr><tr><td>Word Document(*.docx)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5">Authors; Hide Folders</td><td>Word Macro-Enabled Document(*.docm）</td></tr><tr><td>Word97-2003Document（.doc)</td></tr><tr><td>Word Template(*.dotx)</td></tr><tr><td>Word Macro-Enabled Template(*.dotm)</td></tr><tr><td>Word 97-2003Template(*.dot)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">PDF(*.pdf) XPS Document(*xps)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SingleFileWebPage(*.mht;*.mhtml) WebPage(*htm;*.html)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Web Page,Filtered (*.htm;*.html)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RichTextFormat(*.rtf)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PlainText(*.txt)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>WordXMLDocument(*.xml)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Word2003XMLDocument（*xml)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>StrictOpenXMLDocument(.docx)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>OpenDocumentText(*.odt）</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

You can save a document in any of these file formats  

The default file format for files created in Word 2019 is the .docx format, which provides the following benefits over the .doc file format that was the previous standard:  

Decreased file size Files are compressed when saved, decreasing the amount of disk space and bandwidth needed to store and transmit files.  

Simpler retrieval and editing of content XML files can be opened in text-editing apps such as Notepad. Increased security Personal data can be located and removed from the document, and files can’t store macros. (The .docm file format is designed for documents that contain macros.)  

If you want to save a Word document in a format that can be opened by the widest variety of programs (including text editors that are installed with most operating systems), use one of these two formats:  

Rich Text Format (\*.rtf) This format preserves the document’s formatting.   
Plain Text (\*.txt) This format preserves only the document’s text.  

If you want people to be able to view a document exactly as it appears on your screen, use one of these two formats:  

PDF (.pdf) This format is preferred by commercial printing facilities. Recipients can display the file in the free Microsoft Reader or Adobe Reader apps, and can display and edit the file in Word 2019 or Adobe Acrobat. XPS (.xps) This format precisely renders all fonts, images, and colors. Recipients can display the file in Microsoft Reader or the free XPS Viewer app.  

# Tip  

Another way to create a PDF file or XPS file is by selecting that option when sending the document by email. For more information, see “Print and send documents” in Chapter 12, “Finalize and distribute documents.”  

The PDF (Portable Document Format) and XPS (XML Paper Specification) formats are designed to deliver documents as electronic representations of the way they appear when printed. Both types of files can easily be sent by email to many recipients and can be made available on a webpage for downloading by anyone who wants them. However, the files are no longer Word documents. A PDF file can be converted to the editable Word format; an XPS file, however, cannot be opened, viewed, or edited in Word.  

![](images/76e327036b06cd0373ee232d8843886d4e88b9145a607e01a68fb338e7277265.jpg)  

You can create a PDF file from all or part of a document  

When you save a Word document in PDF or XPS format, you can optimize the file size of the document for your intended distribution method—the larger Standard file size is better for printing, whereas the Minimum file size is suitable for online publishing.  

Maintain compatibility with earlier versions of Word  

Word 2003 and earlier versions of Word used the .doc file format. You can open .doc files in Word 2019, but some Word 2019 features will be unavailable.  

When you open a file created in Word 2010 or an earlier version of Word, the title bar displays [Compatibility Mode] to the right of the document name. You can work in Compatibility mode, or you can convert the document to Word 2019 format by selecting the Convert button on the Info page of the Backstage view, or by saving a copy of the document with Word Document as the file type.  

If you work with people who are using a version of Word earlier than Word 2007, you can save your documents in a format that they will be able to use by choosing the Word 97- 2003 file format in the Save As Type list, or they can install the free Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint File Formats from the Microsoft Download Center (located at download.microsoft.com). The Compatibility Pack doesn’t provide additional functionality in the older versions of the apps, but it does enable users of those earlier versions to open current documents, workbooks, and presentations.  

# To save all or part of a document in PDF format  

1. Open the Save As dialog box.  

# https://avxhm.se/blogs/hill0  

2. In the Save as type list, select PDF. The dialog box content changes to provide additional options. 3. If you want to create a PDF file that has a smaller file size (but lower quality), select Minimum size (publishing online). 4. To modify any of the default settings, select the Options button, do any of the following, and then select OK:   
1. Specify the pages to include in the file.   
2. Include or exclude comments and tracked changes.   
3. Include or exclude nonprinting elements such as bookmarks and properties.   
4. Select compliance, font embedding, and encryption options. 5. If you don’t want to automatically open the new PDF file in your default PDF viewer, clear the Open file after publishing check box. 6. In the Save As dialog box, select Save.  

# Close documents  

Every time you open a document, a new instance of Word starts. When you close the file, you can exit that instance of Word. If you have only one document open, you can close the file and exit Word, or you can close the file but leave Word running.  

# To close a document  

 At the right end of the title bar, select the Close button to close the document and the Word window. Display the Backstage view, and then select Close to close the document without exiting Word.   
 On the Windows taskbar, point to the Word button to display thumbnails of all open documents. Point to the thumbnail of the document you want to close, and then select the Close button that appears in its upper-right corner.  

# KEY POINTS  

You can create simple and complex Word documents by selecting a template. You can open more than one Word document, and you can view more than one document at a time, but only one document can be active at a time. It’s easy to move the cursor by clicking in the text or by pressing keys and keyboard shortcuts. Information about a Word document is saved with the document as file properties that are available from the Info page of the Backstage view and from the document’s Properties dialog box. Some properties are created and managed by Word and others are customizable. Word 2019 documents use the.docx file format. When you save a Word document, you specify its location on the Save As page of the Backstage view, and its name and file format in the Save As dialog box. You can save a Word document as a different file type if necessary.  

# https://avxhm.se/blogs/hill0  

 You can display a variety of views of documents, depending on your needs as you create the document and the purpose for which you are creating it.  

![](images/9eb8b359f98e28f6128d9d9b24a000e664f00b694f47423e9812c86fc0e11740.jpg)  


# Create documents  

Perform the following tasks:  

1. Start Word and create a new, blank document.   
2. Display the available templates for new documents. Scroll through the list of featured templates and note the types of documents you can create from them.   
3. Search for a template that’s related to something you’re interested in. For example, you could use a search term such as food, school, children, or customers.   
4. Review the categories in the right pane of the search results. Filter the results by two categories and notice the effect. Then remove one of the category filters. Preview a template from the search results. If the template preview includes multiple images, preview each of those by clicking the arrows below the image.   
5. Without closing the preview window, preview the next or previous template by clicking the arrows to the sides of the preview window.   
6. From the preview window, create a document based on the currently displayed template. Notice that the unsaved blank document remains open.   
7. Close the blank document without saving it. Leave the template-based document open for use in a later set of practice tasks.  

Open and move around in documents  

In Word, perform the following tasks:  

1. Display the Open page of the Backstage view.   
2. If there are files in the Recent list, notice the groups they’re divided into, their file storage locations, and whether any are pinned to the list.

14. On the Open page of the Backstage view, pin the NavigateFiles document to the Recent list.   
15. Close the document without saving it.  

Display different views of documents  

Open the DisplayViews document in Word, and then perform the following tasks:  

1. If the document is not already in Print Layout view, display it in that view.   
2. Switch to Web Layout view and scroll through the document to the end. Notic that the lines break differently and that there are no longer any page breaks.   
3. Move the cursor back to the beginning of the document, and switch to Read Mode view.   
4. On the Read Mode toolbar, select Tools to review the commands on the menu, and then select View to review the commands on that menu. Then, on the View menu, select Edit Document to return to Print Layout view.   
5. In Print Layout view, hide the white space between pages. Scroll through the document and notice the change in the page lengths when the white space is hidden.   
6. Open the Navigation pane and display the document headings. Adjust the pane width to the minimum necessary to display the headings.   
7. Close the Navigation pane.   
8. In the Word Options dialog box, set the width of the style area pane to $\mathbf{2}^{59}$ . Then select OK to return to the document.   
9. Display the document in Draft view. Notice that the style area pane is visible along the left side of the document, but it is wider than necessary.   
10. Drag the style area pane’s right border to the left until it takes up about half the original amount of space.   
11. Display the document in Print Layout view, and use any method described in this chapter to change the magnification to $75\%$ .   
12. Split the window into two panes, position the cursor in the top pane, and then change the magnification to 100%. Notice that only the active pane changes. Then remove the split.   
13. Use commands on the View tab to arrange the DisplayViews document and the document you created in the first set of practice tasks side by side on the screen.   
14. In the DisplayViews document, display the gridlines. Notice that they appear in both open documents.   
15. Switch to the document you created in the first set of practice tasks. Display the rulers. Notice the effect of this action in the other open document.

Notice the information that is available only in the Properties dialog box. 4. Select OK.  

4. Verify that the information you entered in the Properties dialog box appears in the Properties list. If it doesn’t, save, close, and reopen the document to update the properties.  

Save and close documents  

In Word, perform the following tasks:  

1. Save a copy of the EditProperties document in the practice file folder as MyDocument. Close the document and this instance of Word. 2. Close the document you created in the first task without exiting Word. 3. Close the remaining open documents and exit Word.  

# ENTER AND IMPORT TEXT  

Entering new text in a document is easy. A blinking cursor shows where the next character you enter will appear. When you begin entering text, any existing text to the right of the cursor moves to make room for the new text. When the cursor reaches the right margin, the word you are entering moves to the next line.  

![](images/39b542f72ba9b9516df026116be5239d78d9b497b2adf49f2d8fde8a8d8d1bf2.jpg)  

Entering new text in a document is easy  

# Tip  

If a wavy line appears under a word or phrase, Word is flagging a possible error. For information about proofing errors, see “Locate and correct text errors” in Chapter 12, “Finalize and distribute documents.  

If the text you want to add to the document already exists in other documents, you can import it. Importing documents is an easy way to assemble the content of multiple documents into one document. For example, suppose you want to compile eight departmental reports into a company report. It would be tedious to open each report, select and copy the text, and then paste it into the company report document. Instead, you can have Word import the text from those documents in one easy operation.  

There are two fun new ways to add content to a document in Word 2019:  

If you want to use only selected content from another document that is stored on OneDrive or SharePoint and shared with you, you can use the Tap feature to locate and select the online content without ever leaving the document you’re working in. If you prefer, you can dictate text into your document rather than typing it. You can tell Word the text that you want to enter and the punctuation you want to use. Then, when you have the content in the document, you can make any necessary corrections. This feature works best when you have a headset with a microphone that will allow Word to hear you clearly.  

To enter text by typing  

1. Click to position the cursor where you want to add your text, and then begin typing. 2. Press the Enter key at the end of each paragraph to begin a new one.  

# To import text from another document  

1. In the target document, position the cursor where you want to insert the text.  

# Tip  

It isn’t necessary to open the source document to complete this operation.  

2. On the Insert tab, in the Text group, select the Object arrow (not the button). Then select Text from File to open the Insert File dialog box.  

![](images/c733e538122470b751e1ca69a5c74516be4c073e70cd8b4a218d4f6529556036.jpg)  
Import entire documents  

3. Browse to the file that contains the text you want to insert, select the file, and then select the Insert button to import the text into your document.  

# To import text from multiple documents  

1. In the target document, position the cursor where you want to insert text. 2. On the Insert tab, in the Text group, select the Object arrow (not the button) and then, in the list, select Text from File.  

3. In the Insert File dialog box, open the folder that contains the files you want to insert.   
4. If the files containing the text you want to import are listed together, select the first file. Then, while pressing the Shift key, select the last file. All the files will be selected. If the files are not listed together, select the first file. Then, while pressing the Ctrl key, select each additional file.   
5. Select the Insert button. The content of each file you selected will be added to the target document.  

To import selected content from online files  

1. Position the insertion point where you want to insert the content.   
2. On the Insert tab, in the Tap group, select Document Item to open the Insert From File pane.   
3. In the Insert From File pane, scroll, enter text in the search box, or select a filter to locate the document from which you want to insert content.  

4. Click the document thumbnail to display the insertable content within it.  

![](images/071963262ac6952750a1ceb30646eba7dddf157737100674eeaa8af611641920.jpg)  
First locate the file, and then the item that you want to insert  

5. In the Insert From File pane, below the item you want to insert, select Insert Item.  

To dictate text into a document  


# MOVE, COPY, AND DELETE TEXT  

You’ll rarely write a perfect document that requires no editing. You’ll almost always want to add or remove a word or two, change a phrase, or move text from one place to another. Or you might want to edit a document that you created for one purpose so that you can use it for a different purpose. You can edit a document as you create it, or you can write it first and then revise it.  

It’s easy to modify a few characters, but if you want to edit more than that efficiently, you need to know how to select text. Selected text appears highlighted on the screen.  

# Tip  

Many instructional materials incorrectly refer to selecting text as highlighting text, which is misleading. To highlight text is to apply the Highlight character format.  

You can select content by using the mouse, using the keyboard, tapping, or combining multiple selection tools. Some methods of selecting use an area of the document’s left margin called the selection area. When the mouse pointer is in the selection area, it changes to an arrow that points toward the upper-right corner of the page.

You can select an entire line of text with just one click  

# Tip  

When you select content, Word displays the Mini Toolbar, from which you can quickly format the selection or perform other actions, depending on the type of content you select. For information about applying formatting from the Mini Toolbar, see Chapter 4, “Modify the structure and appearance of text.” For information about turning off the display of the Mini Toolbar, see “Change default Word options” in Chapter 16, “Customize options and the user interface.”  

You can move or copy selected text within a document or between documents by using these methods:  

 You can drag a selection from one location to another. This method is easiest to use when you can display the original location and destination on the screen at the same time. (You can create a copy by holding down the Ctrl key while dragging.) You can cut or copy the text from the original location to the Clipboard and then paste it from the Clipboard into the new location. There are multiple  

methods for cutting, copying, and pasting text. No matter which method you use, when you cut text, Word removes it from its original location. When you copy text, Word leaves the original text intact.  

The Clipboard is a temporary storage area shared by the Office apps. You can display items that have been cut or copied to the Clipboard in the Clipboard pane.  

![](images/c1fda3935f8ebd6e2239b7ad377a47d6fed51ef6ea40cd6f2e12f0fb5696eaeb.jpg)  
The Clipboard stores items that have been cut or copied from any Microsoft Office app  

You can cut and copy content to the Clipboard and paste the most recent item from the Clipboard without displaying the Clipboard pane. If you want to work with items other than the most recent, you can display the Clipboard pane and then do so.  

If you make a change to a document and then realize that you made a mistake, you can easily reverse, or undo, one or more recent changes. You can redo changes that you’ve undone or repeat your most recent action elsewhere in the document.  

In addition to moving and copying text, you can also simply delete it. The easiest way to do this is by using the Delete key or the Backspace key. However, when you delete text by using one of these keys, the text is not saved to the Clipboard and you can’t paste it elsewhere.  

To select text  

 To select adjacent words, lines, or paragraphs, drag through the text.   
 Position the cursor at the beginning of the text you want to select, and then do any of the following:   
 To select one character at a time, hold down the Shift key and then press the Left Arrow or Right Arrow key. To select one word at a time, hold down the Shift and Ctrl keys and then press the Left Arrow or Right Arrow key. To select one line at a time, hold down the Shift key and then press the Up Arrow or Down Arrow key. To select any amount of adjacent content, hold down the Shift key and then click at the end of the content that you want to select.   
 To select a word, double-click anywhere in the word. Word selects the word and the space immediately after the word, but not any punctuation after the word. To select a sentence, hold down the Ctrl key and click anywhere in the sentence. Word selects all the characters in the sentence, from the first character through the space following the ending punctuation mark.  


# Tip  

Paragraph marks are nonprinting characters that are usually hidden. For information about displaying nonprinting characters, see “Display different views of documents” in Chapter 2, “Create and manage documents.”  

 To select non-adjacent words, lines, or paragraphs, select the first text segment and then hold down the Ctrl key while selecting the next text segment. To select all the content in a document, text box, shape, or other text container, do either of the following:   
? Triple-click in the selection area.   
 Press $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{A}$ .  

To release a selection

# FIND AND REPLACE TEXT  

One way to ensure that the text in your documents is consistent and accurate is to use the Find feature to search for and review every occurrence of a particular word or phrase. For example, if you are responsible for advertising a trademarked product, you can search your marketing materials to check that every occurrence of the product’s name is correctly identified as a trademark.  

You can use the search box at the top of the Navigation pane to locate all instances of a specific word, phrase, or formatting mark in the current document. When you enter characters in the search box at the top of the pane, Word highlights all occurrences of those characters in the document and displays them on the Results page of the Navigation pane. When you point to a search result on the Results page, a ScreenTip displays the number of the page on which that result appears and the name of the heading preceding the search result. You can select a search result in the pane to move directly to that location in the document, or you can select the Next and Previous arrows to move between results.  

![](images/feeafdb3cb7e17805facaa74c24c2416c294fdd0d8ff9b172af717c8a9bfb5f7.jpg)  


# Tip  

From the Results page of the Navigation pane, you can continue editing your document as you normally would while still having access to all the search results.  

If you want to be more specific about the text you are looking for—for example, if you want to look for occurrences that match the exact capitalization of your search term— you can do so from the Find tab of the Find And Replace dialog box.  

![](images/0a32627328b772ba2aee25938968b30b9218aea54f4badd48071670659bbb5a8.jpg)  

You can make a search more specific by using the criteria in the Search Options area of the Find tab  

If you want to substitute a specific word or phrase for another, you can use the Replace function. As on the Find tab, the Replace tab contains options you can use to carry out more complicated replacement operations. Note that the settings in the Search Options area apply to the search term and not to its replacement.  

![](images/28eaddcde20aab4e99bd41621e367ab369ec277e379d32cf294b8eab9fe24813.jpg)  

Correcting errors and inconsistencies is easy when you use the Replace feature  

You can evaluate and decide whether to replace individual instances of the search term, or you can replace all occurrences of the search term in the document at the same time.  

To display the Results page of the Navigation pane  

On the Home tab, in the Editing group, select the Find button. On the View tab, in the Show group, select the Navigation Pane check box and then, at the top of the Navigation pane, select Results.  Press $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{F}$ .  

# To search for text  

 On the Results page of the Navigation pane, enter the text you want to find in the search box.  

To find a search result in the document  

1. On the Results page of the Navigation pane, point to a search result to display a ScreenTip with the number of the page on which that result appears and the name of the heading that precedes that search result.   
2. Select the search result to move directly to that location in the document.  

To display the Find tab of the Find And Replace dialog box  

In the Navigation pane, select the Search for more things arrow at the right end of the search box, and then select Advanced Find. On the Home tab, in the Editing group, in the Find list, select Advanced Find.  

To conduct a more specific search

3. Do one of the following:  

1. In the Find what box, enter the text you want to search for. 2. Select Special and then select the symbol or formatting symbol you want to locate.   
4. Modify your search by selecting any of the following options in the expanded dialog box:   
0. Guide the direction of the search by selecting Down, Up, or All from the Search list.   
1. Locate only text that matches the capitalization of the search term by selecting the Match case check box.   
2. Exclude occurrences of the search term that appear within other words by selecting the Find whole words only check box. (For example, if you’re searching for the word pan, selecting this check box prevents Word from listing search results such as pane, span, repanel, and so on.)   
3. Find two similar words, such as effect and affect, by selecting the Use wildcardscheck box and then including one or more wildcard characters in the search term.  

The two most common wildcard characters are ?, which represents any single character in this location in the Find What text, and \*, which represents any number of characters in this location in the Find What text. For a list of the available wildcards, select the Use Wildcards check box and then select the Special button.  

4. Find occurrences of the search text that sound the same but are spelled differently, such as there and their, by selecting the Sounds like check box.   
5. Find occurrences of a particular word in any form, such as try, tries, and tried, by selecting the Find all word forms check box.   
6. Locate formatting, such as bold, or special characters, such as tabs, by selecting them from the Format or Special list.   
7. Locate words with the same beginning or end as the search term by selecting the Match prefix or Match suffix check box.   
8. Locate words with different hyphenation or spacing by selecting the Ignore punctuation characters or Ignore white-space characters check box.   
5. Select the Find Next button to find the next instance of the search term in the document.  

# Tip  

You can conduct a more specific search directly from the Navigation pane by selecting the Search For More Things arrow at the right end of the search box and then selecting Options. The Find Options dialog box opens, where you can select many of these same settings while continuing to use the Results page of the Navigation pane to conduct your search.

2. Select Replace All to replace all occurrences of the text in the Find what box with the text in the Replace with box.  

# Tip  

Before selecting Replace All, ensure that the replacement is clearly defined. For example, if you want to change trip to journey, be sure to tell Word to find only the whole word trip; otherwise, the word triple, for example, could become journeyle.  

3. Select Find Next to find the first occurrence of the text in the Find What box or to leave the selected occurrence as it is and locate the next one.  

# USE REFERENCE AND RESEARCH TOOLS  

Language is often contextual. That is, you use different words and phrases in a marketing brochure than you would in a letter requesting immediate payment of an invoice or in an informal memo about a social gathering after work. To help ensure that you use the words that best convey your meaning in any given context, you can look up definitions, synonyms, and antonyms of words from within a document by using Word’s built-in proofing tools. You can also use the selected word as a jumpingoff point for further research.  

You can display definitions of words in the Smart Lookup pane. By default, this pane displays dictionary definitions from online sources.  

![](images/d76a60a0c5f4680fc35e56781775f4509e27c584de1fa386b6fae2674ba10e27.jpg)  
The Smart Lookup pane displays information about the selected word  

You can also install free dictionaries from the Microsoft Office Store. After you install a dictionary, you can display synonyms and definitions in the Thesaurus pane when you’re online or offline.

![](images/5afd8cd8119bef7ad958d5b4d2b17f4b7cb7d128bbb1594b25f65bbafbc69d92.jpg)  



# APPLY PARAGRAPH FORMATTING  

You create a paragraph by entering text and then pressing the Enter key. A paragraph can contain one word, one sentence, or multiple sentences. Every paragraph ends with a paragraph mark, which looks like a backward P (¶). Paragraph marks and other structural characters (such as spaces, line breaks, and tabs) are usually hidden, but you can display them. Sometimes displaying these hidden characters makes it easier to accomplish a task or understand a structural problem.  

![](images/8e8154de8dd562e95f35f8a647a7c97f5989c2ff91a2971dc3af41dfd4fde5c2.jpg)  



# For information about styles, see “Apply built-in styles to text” later in this chapter.  

When you want to make several adjustments to the alignment, indentation, and spacing of selected paragraphs, it is sometimes quicker to make changes in the Paragraph dialog box than to select buttons and drag markers.  

![](images/b0cd98ddd3c575d93ac521924dca64d65c860d27eeb94cd0f6ca16579078a6d0.jpg)  
The Paragraph dialog box  

# Configure alignment  

The alignment settings control the horizontal position of the paragraph text between the page margins. There are four alignment options:  

Align Left This is the default paragraph alignment. It sets the left end of each line of the paragraph at the left page margin or left indent. It results in a straight left edge and a ragged right edge.   
Align Right This option sets the right end of each line of the paragraph at the right page margin or right indent. It results in a straight right edge and a ragged left edge.   
Center This option centers each line of the paragraph between the left and right page margins or indents. It results in ragged left and right edges.   
Justify This option adjusts the spacing between words so that the left end of each line of the paragraph is at the left page margin or indent, and the right end of each line of the paragraph (other than the last line) is at the right margin or indent. It results in straight left and right edges.  

The icons on the alignment buttons on the ribbon depict the effect of each alignment option.  

# To open the Paragraph dialog box  

On the Home tab or the Layout tab, in the Paragraph group, select   
the Paragraph Settings dialog box launcher.   
On the Home tab, in the Paragraph group, select the Line and Paragraph Spacingbutton and then Line Spacing Options.  

To set paragraph alignment  

Position the cursor anywhere in the paragraph, or select all the paragraphs you want to adjust. Then do either of the following: On the Home tab, in the Paragraph group, select the Align Left, Center, Align Right, or Justify button. Open the Paragraph dialog box. On the Indents and Spacing tab, in the Generalarea, select Left, Centered, Right, or Justified in the Alignment list.  

# Configure vertical spacing  

Paragraphs have two types of vertical spacing:  

 Paragraph spacing This is the space between paragraphs, defined by setting the space before and after each paragraph. This space is usually measured in points. Line spacing This is the space between the lines within a paragraph, defined by setting the height of the lines either in relation to the height of the text (single, double, or a specific number of lines) or by specifying a minimum or exact point measurement.  

The default line spacing for documents created in Word 2019 is 1.08 lines. Changing the line spacing alters the appearance and readability of the text in the paragraph and the amount of space it occupies on the page.  

![](images/f050c635f2b90854faf26e0df6a2598693c5ebb4244d2ef97f9efe5c30f69269.jpg)  

# The effect of changing line spacing  

You can set the paragraph and line spacing for individual paragraphs and for paragraph styles. You can quickly adjust the spacing of most content in a document by selecting an option from the Paragraph Spacing menu on the Design tab. (Although the menu is named Paragraph Spacing, the menu options control both paragraph spacing and line spacing.) These options, which are named by effect rather than by specific measurements, work by modifying the spacing of the Normal paragraph style and any other styles that depend on the Normal style for their spacing. (In standard templates, most other styles are based on the Normal style.) The Paragraph Spacing options modify the Normal style in only the current document and do not affect other documents.  

The following table describes the effect of each Paragraph Spacing option on the paragraph and line spacing settings.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Paragraph spacing option</td><td>Before paragraph</td><td>After paragraph</td><td>Line spacing</td></tr><tr><td>Default</td><td>Controlled by style set</td><td>Controlled by style set</td><td>Controlled by style set</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td>No Paragraph Space</td><td>O points</td><td>O points</td><td>1 line</td></tr><tr><td>Compact</td><td>O points</td><td>4 points</td><td>1 line</td></tr><tr><td>Tight</td><td>O points</td><td>6 points</td><td>1.15 lines</td></tr><tr><td>Open</td><td>O points</td><td>10 points</td><td>1.15 lines</td></tr><tr><td>Relaxed</td><td>O points</td><td>6 points</td><td>1.5 lines</td></tr><tr><td>Double</td><td>O points</td><td>8 points</td><td>2 lines</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# To quickly adjust the vertical spacing before, after, and within all paragraphs in a document  

1. On the Design tab, in the Document Formatting group, select Paragraph Spacingto display the Paragraph Spacing menu.  

![](images/bc2fc142c3f8a772126fc0e88cfaa25ec98bbfaef2889df168fa7a4af6fa35b8.jpg)  

Each paragraph spacing option controls space around and within the paragraph  

2. Select the option you want to apply to all the paragraphs in the document. To adjust the spacing between paragraphs 1. Select all the paragraphs you want to adjust.  

2. On the Layout tab, in the Paragraph group, adjust the Spacing Before and Spacing After settings.  

![](images/9f20fceb4f5876b3e63d2b94935f1b3b75d346274b2c73feeb4bac9f0e6572e5.jpg)  
The settings in the Spacing boxes are measured in points  

# To adjust spacing between the lines of paragraphs  

 Position the cursor anywhere in the paragraph, or select all the paragraphs you want to adjust. Do either of the following: To make a quick adjustment to the selected paragraphs, on the Home tab, in the Paragraph group, select the Line and Paragraph Spacing button, and then select any of the line-spacing commands on the menu.  

![](images/bb864f863c0f9802f4d683e1d210574129d49e549fe4743d80f15fc2d4209695.jpg)  

You can choose from preset internal line-spacing options or adjust paragraph spacing  

# Tip  

You can also adjust the space before and after selected paragraphs from the Line And Paragraph Spacing menu. Selecting one of the last two options adds or removes a preset amount of space between the selected paragraphs.  

 To make a more-specific adjustment, open the Paragraph dialog box. Then, on the Indents and Spacing tab, in the Spacing area, make the adjustments you want to the paragraph spacing, and then select OK.  

# Configure indents  

In Word, you don’t define the width of paragraphs and the length of pages by defining the area occupied by the text. Instead, you define the size of the white space—the left, right, top, and bottom margins—around the text.  

For information about setting margins, see “Preview and adjust page layout” in Chapter 12, “Finalize and distribute documents.” For information about sections, see “Control what appears on each page” in the same chapter.  

Although the left and right margins are set for a whole document or for a section of a document, you can vary the position of a paragraph between the margins by indenting the left or right edge of the paragraph.  

A paragraph indent is the space from the page margin to the text. You can change the left indent by selecting buttons on the Home tab, or you can set the indents directly on the ruler. Three indent markers are always present on the ruler:  

Left Indent This defines the outermost left edge of each line of the paragraph.   
Right Indent This defines the outermost right edge of each line of the paragraph.   
First Line Indent This defines the starting point of the first line of the paragraph.  

The ruler indicates the space between the left and right page margins in a lighter color than the space outside of the page margins.  

![](images/95045d416e4d471a98d70bd0e6a63989525c4ec2a7acc5a68f77f7c3c2ad2d3a.jpg)  

# The indent markers on the ruler  

The default setting for the Left Indent and First Line Indent markers is 0.0”, which aligns with the left page margin. The default setting for the Right Indent marker is the distance from the left margin to the right margin. For example, if the page size is set to 8.5 inches wide and the left and right margins are set to 1.0 inch, the default Right Indent marker is at 6.5 inches.  

You can arrange the Left Indent and First Line Indent markers to create a hanging indent or a first line indent. Hanging indents are most commonly used for bulleted and numbered lists, in which the bullet or number is indented less than the main text (essentially, it is outdented). First line indents are frequently used to distinguish the beginning of each subsequent paragraph in documents that consist of many consecutive paragraphs of text. Both types of indents are set by using the First Line Indent marker on the ruler.  

The First Line Indent marker is linked to the Left Indent marker. Moving the Left Indent marker also moves the First Line Indent marker to maintain the first line indent distance. You can move the First Line Indent marker independently of the Left Indent marker to change the first line indent distance.  

To display the ruler  

 On the View tab, in the Show group, select the Ruler check box.  

# Tip  

In this book, we show measurements in inches. If you want to change the measurement units Word uses, open the Word Options dialog box. On the Advanced page, in the Display area, select the units you want in the Show Measurements In Units Of list. Then select OK.  

# To indent or outdent the left edge of a paragraph  

 Position the cursor anywhere in the paragraph or select all the paragraphs you want to adjust. Then do any of the following: On the Home tab, in the Paragraph group, select the Increase Indent or Decrease Indent button to move the left edge of the paragraph in 0.25-inch increments.  

# Tip  

You cannot increase or decrease the indent beyond the margins by using the Increase Indent and Decrease Indent buttons. If you do need to extend an indent beyond the margins, you can do so by setting negative indentation measurements in the Paragraph dialog box. Open the Paragraph dialog box. Then, on the Indents and Spacing tab, in the Indentation area, set the indent in the Left box, and then select OK.  On the ruler, drag the Left Indent marker to the ruler measurement at which you want to position the left edge of the body of the paragraph.  

To create a hanging indent or first line indent  

1. Position the cursor anywhere in the paragraph or select all the paragraphs you want to adjust.   
2. Open the Paragraph dialog box. Then, on the Indents and Spacing tab, in the Indents area, select First line or Hanging in the Special box.   
3. In the By box, set the amount of the indent, and then select OK.   
1. Set the left indent of the paragraph body.   
2. On the ruler, drag the First Line Indent marker to the ruler measurement at which you want to begin the first line of the paragraph.  


# Tip  

Unless the paragraph alignment is justified, the right edge of the paragraph will be ragged, but no line will extend beyond the right indent or outdent.  

Configure paragraph borders and shading  

To make a paragraph really stand out, you might want to put a border around it or shade its background. (For real drama, you can do both.) You can select a predefined border from the Borders menu or design a custom border in the Borders And Shading dialog box.  

![](images/1bb26126582249f1cd0d3cd58789af815f6b2ec95b9fa44ebd1ad6e33cdb9f71.jpg)  

# You can customize many aspects of the border  

After you select the style, color, width, and location of the border, you can select Options to specify its distance from the text.  

# STRUCTURE CONTENT MANUALLY  

At times it’s necessary to manually position text within a paragraph. You can do this by using two different hidden characters: line breaks and tabs. These characters are visible only when the option to show paragraph marks and formatting symbols is turned on.  

These hidden characters have distinctive appearances:  

A line break character looks like a bent left-pointing arrow $(\leftarrow)$  

# A tab character looks like a right-pointing arrow $(\rightarrow)$  

You can use a line break, also known as a soft return, to wrap a line of a paragraph in a specific location without ending the paragraph. You might use this technique to display only specific text on a line, or to break a line before a word that would otherwise be hyphenated.  

# Tip  

Inserting a line break does not start a new paragraph, so when you apply paragraph formatting to a line of text that ends with a line break, the formatting is applied to the entire paragraph, not only to that line.  

![](images/f0945960c6e1950bea8c71912ca294dbe0a7197333cde69a4db628b48f7d3af3.jpg)  


# You can specify the alignment and tab leader for each tab  

You might also work from this dialog box if you want to use tab leaders—visible marks such as dots or dashes connecting the text before the tab with the text after it. For example, tab leaders are useful in a table of contents to carry the eye from the text to the page number.  

When you insert tab characters, the text to the right of the tab character aligns on the tab stop according to its type. For example, if you set a center tab stop, pressing the Tab key moves the text so that its center is aligned with the tab stop.  

To display or hide paragraph marks and other structural characters  

 On the Home tab, in the Paragraph group, select the Show/Hide $^\mathparagraph$ button.   
 Press $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{Shift}{+}\mathbf{8\left(Ctrl+^{\ast}\right)}$ .  

To insert a line break  

Position the cursor where you want to break the line. Then do either of the following: On the Layout tab, in the Page Setup group, select Breaks and then Text Wrapping.  Press Shift $^{+}$ Enter.  

To insert a tab character  

 Position the cursor where you want to add the tab character, and then press the Tab key.  

# To open the Tabs dialog box  

1. Select any portion of one or more paragraphs that you want to manage tab stops for.   
2. Open the Paragraph dialog box.   
3. In the lower-left corner of the Indents and Spacing tab, select the Tabs button.  

To align a tab and set a tab stop  

1. Select any portion of one or more paragraphs that you want to set the tab stop for.   
2. Display the ruler, if it isn’t shown, by selecting the Ruler check box in the Show group on the View tab.   
3. Select the Tab button at the left end of the ruler to cycle through the tab stop alignments, in this order:  

1. Left   
2. Center   
3. Right   
4. Decimal   
5. Bar  

4. When the Tab button shows the alignment you want, select the ruler at the point where you want to set the tab.  

# Tip  

When you manually align a tab and set a tab stop, Word removes any default tab stops to the left of the one you set. (It doesn’t remove any manually set tab stops.)  


# APPLY CHARACTER FORMATTING  

The appearance of your document helps convey not only the document’s message but also information about the document’s creator: you. A neatly organized document that contains consistently formatted content and appropriate graphic elements, and that doesn’t contain spelling or grammatical errors, invokes greater confidence in your ability to provide any product or service.  

Earlier in this chapter, you learned about methods of applying formatting to paragraphs. This topic covers methods of formatting the text of a document. Formatting that you apply to text is referred to as character formatting.  

In Word documents, you can apply three types of character formatting:  

 Individual character formats including font, font size, font color, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, subscript, superscript, and highlight color Artistic text effects that incorporate character outline and fill colors Preformatted styles associated with the document template, many of which not only affect the appearance of the text but also convey structural information (such as titles and headings)  

When you enter text in a document, it is displayed in a specific font. By default, the font used for text in a new blank document is 11-point Calibri, However, you can change the font of any text element at any time. The available fonts vary from one computer to another, depending on the apps installed. Common fonts include Arial, Verdana, and Times New Roman.  

You can vary the look of a font by changing the following attributes:  

 Size Almost every font has a range of sizes you can select from. (Sometimes you can set additional sizes beyond those listed.) The font size is measured in points, from the top of the ascenders (the letter parts that go up, like the left line of the letter $h_{\cdot}$ ) to the bottom of the descenders (the letter parts that drop down, like the left line of the letter $p$ ). A point is approximately $\mathbf{1/72}$ of an inch (about 0.04 centimeters). Style Almost every font has a range of font styles. The most common are regular (or plain), italic, bold, and bold italic. Effects Fonts can be enhanced by applying effects, such as underlining, small capital letters (small caps), or shadows. Character spacing You can alter the spacing between characters by pushing them apart or squeezing them together.  

Although some attributes might cancel each other out, they are usually cumulative. For example, you might use a bold font style in various sizes and colors to make words stand out in a newsletter.  

You apply character formatting from one of three locations:  

Mini Toolbar Several common formatting buttons are available on the Mini Toolbar that appears temporarily when you select text.  

![](images/a570112d26c5f2638686d5cc067b1f3c9f80970ad2700681cb587d438ee9d55b.jpg)  

The Mini Toolbar appears temporarily when you select text, becomes transparent when you move the pointer away from the selected text, and disappears if not used  

Font group on the Home tab This group includes buttons for changing the font and most of the font attributes you are likely to use.  

![](images/91ac2dcab05b15f0ac250fd540137d0354bb8f66c3c5fff993f16238b9c97a0b.jpg)  

The most common font formatting commands are available on the Home tab  Font dialog box Less commonly applied attributes such as small caps and special underlining are available from the Font dialog box.  

![](images/7f0be1e4874f1569358db6403db0a080095e043ba61b521e8209e06a8f41657e.jpg)  

Font attributes that aren’t available on the Home tab can be set in the Font dialog box  

In addition to applying character formatting to change the look of characters, you can apply predefined text effects (sometimes referred to as WordArt) to a selection to add more zing. The available effects match the current theme colors.  

#  

![](images/b4fc13a15dcd7aaf4b94b7dd5e003f8cfb9d5e04ee4c5fc2f34c10411e6cece7.jpg)  

# You can apply any predefined effect in the gallery or define a custom effect  

These effects are somewhat dramatic, so you’ll probably want to restrict their use to document titles and similar elements to which you want to draw particular attention.  

# To change the font of selected text  

On the Mini Toolbar or in the Font group on the Home tab, in the Font list, select the font you want to apply.  

To change the font size of selected text  

Do any of the following on the Mini Toolbar or in the Font group on the Home tab: In the Font Size list, select the font size you want to apply. In the Font Size box, enter the font size you want to apply (even a size that doesn’t appear in the list). Then press the Enter key. To increase the font size in set increments, select the Increase Font Size button or press $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}>$ . To decrease the font size in set increments, select the Decrease Font Size button or press $\mathbf{Ctrl}+<$ .  

To format selected text as bold, italic, or underlined  

 On the Mini Toolbar, select the Bold, Italic, or Underline button. On the Home tab, in the Font group, select the Bold, Italic, or Underline button. Press $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{B}$ to format the text as bold.   
 Press $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{I}$ to format the text as italic.   
 Press $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{U}$ to underline the text.  

# Tip  

To quickly apply a different underline style to selected text, select the arrow next to the Underline button on the Home tab, and then in the list, select the underline style you want to apply.  

To cross out selected text by drawing a line through it  On the Home tab, in the Font group, select the Strikethrough button.  

To display superscript or subscript characters  

1. Select the characters you want to display in superscript or subscript form.   
2. On the Home tab, in the Font group, do either of the following: 1. Select the Subscript button to decrease the size of the selected characters and shift them to the bottom of the line. 2. Select the Superscript button to decrease the size of the selected characters and shift them to the top of the line.  

To apply artistic effects to selected text  

On the Home tab, in the Font group, select the Text Effects and Typography button, and then do either of the following: In the Text Effects and Typography gallery, select the preformatted effect combination that you want to apply. On the Text Effects and Typography menu, select Outline, Shadow, Reflection, Glow, Number Styles, Ligatures, or Stylistic Sets. Then make selections on the submenus to apply and modify those effects.  

To change the font color of selected text  

1. On the Home tab, in the Font group, select the Font Color arrow to display the Font Color menu.   
2. In the Theme Colors or Standard Colors palette, select a color swatch to apply that color to the selected text.  

# Tip  

To apply the Font Color button’s current color, you can simply select the button (not its arrow). If you want to apply a color that is not shown in the Theme Colors or Standard Colors palette, select More Colors. In the Colors dialog box, select the color you want in the honeycomb on the Standard page, select the color gradient, or enter values for a color on the Custom page.  

# To change the case of selected text  

 On the Home tab, in the Font group, select the Change Case button and then select Sentence case, lowercase, UPPERCASE, Capitalize Each Word, or tOGGLE cASE. Press Shift $\mathbf{\sigma}_{\cdot+\mathbf{F}3}$ repeatedly to cycle through the standard case options (Sentence case, UPPERCASE, lowercase, and Capitalize Each Word).  

The case options vary based on the selected text. If the selection ends in a period, Word does not include the Capitalize Each Word option in the rotation. If the selection does not end in a period, Word does not include Sentence case in the rotation.  

# To highlight text  

 Select the text you want to highlight, and then do either of the following:   
 On the Mini Toolbar or in the Font group on the Home tab, select the Text Highlight Color button to apply the default highlight color.

To open the Font dialog box  

 On the Home tab, in the Font group, select the Font dialog box launcher.   
 Press $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{Shiff}{+}\mathbf{F}$ .  

To remove character formatting  

Select the text you want to clear the formatting from. Then do any of the following: Press Ctrl $^+$ Spacebar to remove manually applied formatting (but not styles). On the Home tab, in the Font group, select the Clear All Formatting button to remove all styles and formatting other than highlighting from selected text.  


# CREATE AND MODIFY LISTS  

Lists are paragraphs that start with a character—usually a number or bullet—and are formatted with a hanging indent so the character stands out on the left end of each list item. Fortunately, Word takes care of the formatting of lists for you. You simply indicate the type of list you want to create.  

When the order of items is not important—for example, for a list of people or supplies—a bulleted list is the best choice. When the order is important—for example, for the steps in a procedure—you should create a numbered list.  

You can format an existing set of paragraphs as a list or create the list as you enter text into the document. After you create a list, you can modify, format, and customize the list as follows:  

You can move items around in a list, insert new items, or delete unwanted items. If the list is numbered, Word automatically updates the numbers. You can modify the indentation of the list. You can change both the overall indentation of the list and the relationship of the first line to the other lines. For a bulleted list, you can sort list items alphabetically in ascending or descending order, change the bullet symbol, or define a custom bullet (even a picture bullet). For a numbered list, you can change the number style to use different punctuation, roman numerals, or letters, or define a custom style, and you can specify the starting number.  

To format a new bulleted or numbered list as you enter content  

With the cursor at the position in the document where you want to start the list, do either of the following: To start a new bulleted list, enter \* (an asterisk) at the beginning of a paragraph, and then press the Spacebar or the Tab key before entering the list item text. To start a new numbered list, enter 1. (the number 1 followed by a period) at the beginning of a paragraph, and then press the Spacebar or the Tab key before entering the list item text. When you start a list in this fashion, Word automatically formats the text as a bulleted or numbered list. When you press Enter to start a new item, Word continues the formatting to the new paragraph. Typing text and pressing Enter adds subsequent bulleted or numbered items. To end the list, press Enter twice; or select the Bullets arrow or Numbering arrow in the Paragraph group on the Home tab, and then in the gallery, select None.  

# Tip  

If you want to start a paragraph with an asterisk or number but don’t want to format the paragraph as a bulleted or numbered list, select the AutoCorrect Options button that appears after Word changes the formatting, and then in the list, select the appropriate Undo option. You can also select the Undo button on the Quick Access Toolbar or press $\mathrm{Ctrl}{+}Z$ .  

To convert paragraphs to bulleted or numbered list items  

1. Select the paragraphs that you want to convert to list items.   
2. On the Home tab, in the Paragraph group, do either of the following: 1. Select the Bullets button to convert the selection to a bulleted list. 2. Select the Numbering button to convert the selection to a numbered list.  

# To create a list with multiple levels  

1. Start creating a bulleted or numbered list.   
2. When you want the next list item to be at a different level, do either of the following:   
1. To create the next item one level lower (indented more), press the Tab key at the beginning of that paragraph before you enter the lowerlevel list item text.   
2. To create the next item one level higher (indented less), press Shift $^{+}$ Tab at the beginning of the paragraph before you enter the higher-level list item text. In the case of a bulleted list, Word changes the bullet character for each item level. In the case of a numbered list, Word changes the type of numbering used, based on a predefined numbering scheme.  

For a multilevel list, you can change the numbering pattern or bullets by selecting the Multilevel List button in the Paragraph group on the Home tab and then selecting the pattern you want, or you can define a custom pattern by selecting Define New Multilevel List.  

# To modify the indentation of a list  

Select the list items whose indentation you want to change, and do any of the following: On the Home tab, in the Paragraph group, select the Increase Indent button to move the list items to the right. In the Paragraph group, select the Decrease Indent button to move the list items to the left.   
 Display the ruler and drag the indent markers to the left or right.  

# Tip  

You can adjust the space between the bullets and their text by dragging only the Hanging Indent marker.  


# To change the bullet symbol  

1. Select the bulleted list whose bullet symbol you want to change. 2. On the Home tab, in the Paragraph group, select the Bullets arrow. 3. In the Bullets gallery, select the new symbol you want to use to replace the bullet character that begins each item in the selected list.  

To define a custom bullet  

1. In the Bullets gallery, select Define New Bullet. 2. In the Define New Bullet dialog box, select the Symbol, Picture, or Font button, and then select from the wide range of options. 3. Select OK to apply the new bullet style to the list.  

To change the number style  

1. Select the numbered list whose number style you want to change.   
2. On the Home tab, in the Paragraph group, select the Numbering arrow to display the Numbering gallery.   
3. Make a new selection to change the style of the number that begins each item in the selected list.  

To define a custom number style  

1. In the Numbering gallery, select Define New Number Format.  

2. In the Define New Number Format dialog box, do either of the following: 1. Change the selections in the Number Style, Number Format, or Alignmentboxes. 2. Select the Font button and then select from the wide range of options.  

3. Select OK to apply the new numbering style to the list.  

To start a list or part of a list at a predefined number  

1. Place the cursor within an existing list, in the list paragraph whose number you want to set.   
2. Display the Numbering gallery, and then select Set Numbering Value to open the Set Numbering Value dialog box.   
3. Do either of the following to permit custom numbering:  

1. Select Start new list.  

2. Select Continue from previous list, and then select the Advance value (skip numbers) check box.  

4. In the Set value to box, enter the number you want to assign to the list item. Then select OK.  

![](images/40c02db7f2c76e4e80af92702bc4f26213c2d79e9d760b1a55e39760458c99a9.jpg)  

You can start or restart a numbered list at any number  

Format text as you type  

The Word list capabilities are only one example of the app’s ability to intuit how you want to format an element based on what you type. You can learn more about these and other AutoFormatting options by exploring the AutoCorrect dialog box, which you can open from the Proofing page of the Word Options dialog box.  

The AutoFormat As You Type page shows the options Word implements by default, including bulleted and numbered lists.  

![](images/09d8ccd1652e4950a8f3e3d3a46e4bba15b70ccf713d61678789fcafe230e426.jpg)  

# You can select and clear options to control automatic formatting behavior  

One interesting option in this dialog box is Border Lines. When this check box is selected, typing three consecutive hyphens (---) or three consecutive underscores (___) and pressing Enter draws a single line across the page. Typing three consecutive equal signs $(===$ and pressing Enter draws a double line. Typing three consecutive tildes $(\sim\sim\sim)$ and pressing Enter draws a zigzag line.  

# APPLY BUILT-IN STYLES TO TEXT  

You don’t have to know much about character and paragraph formatting to format your documents in ways that will make them easier to read and more professional looking. With a couple of mouse clicks or screen taps, you can easily change the look of words, phrases, and paragraphs by using styles. More importantly, you can build a document outline that is reflected in the Navigation pane and use it to create a table of contents.  

![](images/aa3450cf7280d7d5ad1cfc59b8c371757f20fcf598f26fc211b1ec9ca426ba65.jpg)  


# Apply styles  

Styles can include character formatting (such as font, size, and color), paragraph formatting (such as line spacing and outline level), or a combination of both. Styles are stored in the template that is attached to a document.  

By default, blank new documents are based on the Normal template. The Normal template includes a standard selection of styles that fit the basic needs of most documents. These styles include nine heading levels, various text styles including those for multiple levels of bulleted and numbered lists, index and table of contents entry styles, and many specialized styles such as those for hyperlinks, quotations, placeholders, captions, and other elements.  

By default, most common predefined styles are available in the Styles gallery on the Home tab. You can add styles to the gallery or remove those that you don’t often use.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>AaBbCcDc Normal</td><td>AaBbCcDc No Spac...</td><td>AaBbC Heading1</td><td>AaBbCcC Heading2</td><td>AaB Title</td><td>AaBbCcC Subtitle</td></tr><tr><td>AaBbCcD</td><td>AaBbCcD</td><td></td><td>AaBbCcDAaBbCcDcAaBbCcD</td><td></td><td>AaBbCcD</td></tr><tr><td>SubtleEm...</td><td>Emphasis</td><td>IntenseE...</td><td>Strong</td><td>Quote</td><td>Intense Q...</td></tr><tr><td>AABBCCDE</td><td>AABBCCDE</td><td>AaBbCcD</td><td>AaBbCcDc</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SubtleRef...IntenseR...</td><td>BookTitle</td><td>TList Para...</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">CreateaStyle ClearFormatting</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# The Styles gallery in a new, blank document based on the Normal template  

Styles stored in a template are usually based on the Normal style and use only the default body and heading fonts associated with the document’s theme, so they all go together well. For this reason, formatting document content by using styles produces a harmonious effect. After you apply named styles, you can easily change the look of an entire document by switching to a different style set that contains styles with the same names but different formatting.  

![](images/08b56557cb4afc3a6cf7b661aca67adc563889f3fe28dfacd36b8e191c3c2514.jpg)  


# Tip  

Style sets provide a quick and easy way to change the look of an existing document. You can also modify style definitions by changing the template on which the document is based. For more information about styles and templates, see “Create and modify styles” and “Create and attach templates” in Chapter 15, “Create custom document elements.”  

To open the Styles pane  

On the Home tab, select the Styles dialog box launcher.  

![](images/400766c92fa4a91b1426654f199e8269b6c2cb673255158abf2a91e590a4c9e6.jpg)  

# Tip  

If the Styles pane floats above the page, you can drag it by its title bar to the right or left edge of the app window to dock it.  

To change which styles are displayed in the Styles pane  

1. Open the Styles pane, and then select Options.  

![](images/2503ea6b412aabcd266ae14d9c6cf96c04365c2ba7a37c9bdbe4ac7187e0df2c.jpg)  

To make it easier to find specific styles, sort the list alphabetically  

2. In the Style Pane Options dialog box, do any of the following, and then select OK:  

1. In the Select styles to show list, select one of the following:  

1. Recommended Displays styles that are tagged in the template as recommended for use  

2. In use Displays styles that are applied to content in the current document  

3. In current document Displays styles that are in the template that is attached to the current document  

4. All styles Displays built-in styles, styles that are in the attached template, and styles that were brought into the document from other templates  

2. In the Select how list is sorted list, select Alphabetical, As Recommended, Font, Based on, or By type.  

3. In the Select formatting to show as styles area, select each check box for which you want to display variations from named styles.  

4. In the Select how built-in style names are shown area, select the check box for each option you want to turn on.  

To display or hide style previews in the Styles pane  

Open the Styles pane, and then select or clear the Show Preview check box.  

To add a style to the Styles gallery  

In the Styles pane, point to the style, select the arrow that appears, and then select Add to Style Gallery.  

To remove a style from the Styles gallery  

 In the Styles pane, point to the style, select the arrow that appears, and then select Remove from Style Gallery.  

In the Styles gallery, right-click the style, and then select Remove from Style Gallery.  

# To apply a built-in style  

1. Select the text or paragraph to which you want to apply the style.  

# Tip  

If the style you want to apply is a paragraph style, you can position the cursor anywhere in the paragraph. If the style you want to apply is a character style, you must select the text.  

2. In the Styles gallery on the Home tab, or in the Styles pane, select the style you want to apply.  

# To change the style set  

1. On the Design tab, in the Document Formatting group, select the More button to display all the style sets (if necessary). 2. Point to any style set to preview its effect on the document. 3. Select the style set you want to apply.  

# Manage outline levels  

Styles can be used for multiple purposes: to affect the appearance of the content, to build a document outline, and to tag content as a certain type so that you can easily locate it.  

![](images/1c70957ce489217344458493c325cb050bdc67676029cbad27e829357a5d7633.jpg)  
Heading styles define a document’s outline  

Each paragraph style has an associated Outline Level setting. Outline levels include Body Text and Level 1 through Level 9. Most documents use only body text and the first three or four outline levels.  

![](images/2cba08e2a7b0c237ab4c571b2e97fde9bf82c12426c3f2d3585b89956e614920.jpg)  

# Most documents use only two to four of the outline levels  

Paragraphs that have the Level 1 through Level 9 outline levels become part of the hierarchical structure of the document. They appear as headings in the Navigation pane and act as handles for the content that appears below them in the hierarchy. You can collapse and expand the content below each heading, and move entire sections of content by dragging the headings in the Navigation pane.  

# To display the document outline in the Navigation pane  

 In the Navigation pane, select Headings to display the document structure.  

# Tip  

Only headings that are styled with the document heading styles appear in the Navigation pane.  

To expand or collapse the outline in the Navigation pane In the Navigation pane, do either of the following: If there is a white triangle to the left of a heading, select it to expand that heading to show its subheadings. If there is a downward-angled black triangle to the left of a heading, select it to collapse the subheadings under that heading.  

# Tip  

If there is no triangle next to a heading, that heading does not have subheadings.  

# To expand or collapse sections in the document  

In a document that contains styles, point to a heading to display a triangle to its left. Then do either of the following:   
If the triangle is a downward-angled gray triangle, select the triangle to hide the content that follows the heading.  

If the triangle is a white triangle, select the triangle to display the hidden document content.  

# CHANGE THE DOCUMENT THEME  

Every document you create is based on a template, and the look of the template is controlled by a theme. The theme is a combination of coordinated colors, fonts, and effects that visually convey a certain tone. To change the look of a document, you can apply a different theme from the Themes gallery.  

![](images/aeaf98420550be4a9a282fa685c44e7f3aec880bcd880fe33422f2a3dc86dfb4.jpg)  
The default installation of Word 2019 offers 34 themes to choose from  

Each theme has a built-in font set and color set, and an associated effect style.  

Each font set includes two font definitions: one for headings and one for body text. In some font sets, the heading and body fonts are the same. Each color in a color set has a specific role in the formatting of styled elements. For example, the first color in each set is applied to the Title and Intense Reference styles, and different shades of the third color are applied to the Subtitle, Heading 1, and Heading 2 styles.  

If you like the background elements of a theme but not the colors or fonts, you can mix and match theme elements.  

![](images/3d42073dc7b8a46cb2892606ba4d4ef922934b61cda5165982fa9d55de34c83a.jpg)  

Word 2019 offers thousands of different combinations for creating a custom theme that meets your exact needs  


# Tip  

In addition to colors and fonts, you can control the subtler design elements associated with a theme, such as paragraph spacing and visual effects.  

If you create a combination of theme elements that you would like to use with other documents, you can save the combination as a new theme. By saving the theme in the default Document Themes folder, you make the theme available in the Themes gallery. However, you don’t have to store custom themes in the Document Themes folder; you can store them anywhere on your hard disk, on removable media, or in a network location.  

Tip  

The default Document Themes folder is stored within your user profile. On a default freestanding installation, the folder is located at C:\Users\<user   
name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes. In a corporate environment with managed computer configurations, the user profile folder might be located elsewhere.  

By default, Word applies the Office theme to all new, blank documents. In Word 2019, the Office theme uses a primarily blue palette, the Calibri font for body text, and Calibri Light for headings. If you plan to frequently use a theme other than the Office theme, you can make that the default theme.  

# Tip  

If multiple people create corporate documents for your company, you can ensure that everyone’s documents have a common look and feel by assembling a custom theme and making it available to everyone. Use theme elements that reflect your corporate colors, fonts, and visual style, and then save the theme to a central location or send the theme file by email and instruct your colleagues to save it to the default Document Themes folder.  

# To apply a built-in theme to a document  

On the Design tab, in the Document Formatting group, select the Themes button, and then select the theme you want to apply.  

# Tip  

If you have manually applied formatting to document content, the theme does not override the manual formatting. To ensure that all document elements are controlled by the theme, select Reset To The Default Style Set on the Document Formatting menu.

# KEY POINTS  

You can format many aspects of a paragraph, including its indentation, alignment, internal line spacing, preceding and following space, border, and background. Within a paragraph, you can control the content structure by using hidden line breaks and tabs, and the appearance of the content by changing the size, color, style, effects, and spacing of the text. You can apply paragraph and character formatting manually, or you can format multiple elements of a paragraph, and control the outline level of the content, by using styles. You can change the formatting applied by all the styles within a document by changing the document theme or any individual element of the theme, such as the theme colors, theme fonts, or theme effects. To make a set of items or instructions stand out from the surrounding text, yo can format it as an ordered (numbered) or unordered (bulleted) list.

You can format text to flow in columns  

Columns can be divided by empty space or by vertical lines. When you format text to flow in columns, the text fills the first column on each page and then moves to the top of the next column. When all the columns on one page are full, the text moves to the next page. You can manually adjust the text flow within columns and across pages so it looks the way you want.  


# The Columns gallery displays the predefined column options  

If the standard options don’t suit your needs, choose More Columns. This opens the Columns dialog box, where you can specify the number and width of columns. The number of columns is limited by the width and margins of the page. Each column must be at least a half inch (or 0.27 centimeter) wide.  

![](images/ab44aea1f9652f2f8b047b8081250b2b6610048202c822984485c33a93ec1d73.jpg)  
For more options, you can open the Columns dialog box  

You can format an entire document or a section of a document in columns. When you select a section of text and format it in columns, Word inserts section breaks at the beginning and end of the selected text to delineate the area in which the columnar formatting is applied. Within the columnar text, you can insert column breaks to specify where you want to end one column and start another. Section and column breaks are visible when you display hidden formatting marks in the document.  



# Tip  

Selecting the Line Between check box in the Columns dialog box inserts a vertical line between columns. This can more clearly denote the separation of the columns, which is especially helpful if you have reduced the space between columns to fit more content on a page.

Wider columns display more content and generally look neater on the page  

To lessen the amount of white space within a line, you can set up Word to hyphenate the text and break longer words into syllables.  

![](images/6b8175f3d5f9aa0a04094e1459639a7e8a5a71545a9ed6c2e75023d79e665d76.jpg)  

When hyphenating a document, you can specify whether you want to allow stacked hyphens at the ends of consecutive lines of a paragraph  

 To emphasize a certain portion of the text, you can indent it in the column.  

![](images/afdc4e1a6472697e069e4e95576425c9d5176371dadac3fd8b7bc4cc17bd2fe1.jpg)  

# You can change the indentation of individual paragraphs within a column  

You can manually break columns. When you break a column, the text after the break moves to the top of the next column. You might manually break a column to even out the text along the bottom of the page or if you just want certain text to appear at the top of the next column.  

![](images/53731ee635234105fc9e07e88764432a29b650f98ccdf8ec67ae2684f4aeff86.jpg)  

Manually break columns to even out the text at the end of a page  

# Tip  

To make columns easier to work with, display formatting marks and the ruler before you begin.  

1. Do either of the following:  

1. To format only a section of the document, select the paragraphs that you want to display in columns. 2. To format the entire document with the same number of columns, position the cursor anywhere in the document—you don’t have to select the text.   
2. On the Layout tab, in the Page Setup group, select Columns.   
3. In the Columns gallery, do either of the following:   
0. Select one of the thumbnails to flow the selected text into that column configuration.   
1. At the bottom of the gallery, select More Columns to display the Columns dialog box. Make the adjustments you want, and then select OK.  

To justify column text  

Select the columns you want to align. Then do either of the following:  On the Home tab, in the Paragraph group, select the Justify button.  Press $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{J}$ .  


# To resize columns  

1. Position the cursor anywhere in the columnar text.   
2. On the Layout tab, at the bottom of the Columns gallery, select More Columns to open the Columns dialog box.   
3. In the Width box for any of the columns, enter or select a new width. The Width measurements for the other columns change to match, and the width of all the columns changes. The columns in the Preview thumbnail reflect the new settings.   
4. When the column width is changed to your satisfaction, select OK.   
1. Position the cursor anywhere in the columnar text.   
2. On the horizontal ruler, drag the margins to expand or contract the columns to the width you want.  


# Tip  

To display the rulers, select the Ruler check box in the Show group on the View tab.  

To hyphenate document content  

On the Layout tab, in the Page Setup group, select   
the Hyphenation button, and then select Automatic to hyphenate the text of the document.  

To change the indentation of a paragraph in a column  

1. Position the cursor anywhere in the paragraph you want to indent.  

2. To change the left indentation, do any of the following on the horizontal ruler: 1. Drag the column’s First Line Indent marker to the right to indent only the first line of the paragraph. 2. Drag the column’s Hanging Indent marker to the right to indent all but the first line of the paragraph. 3. Drag the column’s Left Indent marker to the right to indent all lines of the paragraph.   
3. To change the right indentation of all lines of a paragraph, drag the column’s Right Indent marker to the left.

1. Position the cursor at the beginning of the line you want to flow to the next column.   
2. In the Page Setup group of the Layout tab, select Breaks, and then select Column to insert a column break. The text that follows the column break moves to the top of the next column.  

# CREATE TABBED LISTS  

If you have a relatively small amount of data to present, you might choose to display it in a tabbed list. A tabbed list arranges text in simple columns separated by tabs.  

If some text items in the list are longer than others, the columns might not line up at first. You can align the text within the columns by using left, right, centered, or decimal tab stops.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="5">Consultation-Fee-Schedule</td></tr><tr><td>Location</td><td></td><td>Discount-Applies</td><td></td><td>Hourly-RateT</td></tr><tr><td>In-home</td><td></td><td>No</td><td></td><td>$50.00</td></tr><tr><td>Phone</td><td></td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td>$35.00T</td></tr><tr><td>In.store</td><td></td><td>Yes</td><td></td><td>$40.001</td></tr></table></body></html>  

An easy way to present data is to create a tabbed list  


# Tip  

It’s more efficient to make all character and paragraph formatting changes to the text before setting tab stops. Otherwise, you might have to adjust the tab stops after applying the formatting.  

# To create a tabbed list  

1. Open a document to which you want to add a tabbed list, and display formatting marks and the rulers.   
2. Position the cursor in the document where you want to create the tabbed list, enter the text that you want to appear in the top line of the left column, and press Tab.   
3. Enter the text you want to appear in the top line of the second column, and press Tab.   
4. Repeat this action for each additional column you want to create. After you enter the text for the top line in the final column, press Enter.   
5. Add more lines to the list by entering your content and pressing the Tab key t move to the next column or the Enter key to move to the next row.   
6. When you have finished creating the list, select the entire list.   
7. Set the custom tab stops you want for the list.  

# To format column headings for a tabbed list  

1. Select the first line of the tabbed list.   
2. Do one of the following:  

1. On the Mini Toolbar that appears, or in the Font group on the Home tab, select the Bold, Italic, or Underline button, or select the Font Color arrow and then the color you want to apply.  

2. Press $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{B}$ to apply bold, $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{I}$ to apply italic, or $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{U}$ to apply underlining.  

To indent a tabbed list  

1. Select all the lines of the tabbed list, including the headings. 2. On the Layout tab, in the Paragraph group, in the Indent area, enter or select a value in the Left box.  

To change the alignment of a column  

1. Select all the lines of the tabbed list.  

2. On the horizontal ruler, double-click any tab marker to open the Tabs dialog box.   
3. In the Tab stop position box, select the tab stop you want to change and then, in the Alignment area, select the alignment you want.   
4. In the Tabs dialog box, select OK.  

# PRESENT INFORMATION IN TABLES  

A table is a structure of vertical columns and horizontal rows. Each column and each row can be identified by a heading, although some tables have only column headings or only row headings. The box at the junction of each column and row is a cell in which you can store data (text or numeric information). A table is an excellent way to present structured information; it makes it easy to compare information in various categories.  

You can create tables in a Word document in the following ways:  

To create a blank table of up to 10 columns and eight rows, you can display the Insert Table gallery and menu. The gallery is a simple grid that represents columns and rows of cells. When you point to a cell in the grid, Word outlines the cells that would be included in a table created by selecting that cell and displays a live preview of the prospective table. Selecting a cell in the grid inserts an empty table the width of the text column. The table has the number of rows and columns you indicated in the grid, with each row one line high and all the columns of an equal width.   
To create a more customized empty table, use the Insert Table dialog box. Here, you can specify the number of columns and rows and the width of the table and its columns.   
To manually create an empty table, use the Draw Table feature, available from the Insert Table menu. When you select this option, the cursor shape changes to a pencil, which you use to draw cells directly in the Word document to create a table. Word snaps the drawn cells to a grid for uniform sizing and spacing of the rows and columns. You can adjust these manually  

# Tip  

When drawing a table, you can display the rulers or gridlines to help guide you in placing the lines. For more information about rulers, see “Display different views of documents” in Chapter 2, “Create and manage documents.” For information about controlling document gridlines, see “Arrange objects on a page” in Chapter 10, “Organize and arrange content.”  


# Tip  

The end-of-cell markers and end-of-row markers are identical in appearance and are visible only when you display formatting marks in the document. The move handle and size handle appear only in Print Layout view and Web Layout view.  

After you create a table in Word, you can enter data (such as text, numbers, or graphics) into the table cells. You can format the data in a table as you would any other text in Word, changing the font, aligning the text, and so on. You can also sort data in a table. For example, in a table that has the column headings Name, Address, Postal Code, and Phone Number, you can sort on any one of those columns to arrange the information in alphabetical or numerical order.  

When you want to perform calculations on numbers in a Word table, you can create a formula by using the tools in the Formula dialog box.  

To use a function other than SUM in the Formula dialog box, you select the function you want in the Paste Function list. You can use built-in functions to perform a number of calculations, including averaging (AVERAGE) a set of values, counting (COUNT) the number of values in a column or row, or finding the maximum (MAX) or minimum (MIN) value in a series of cells.

You can easily create a formula to calculate a value in a table  

Although formulas commonly refer to the cells above or to the left of the active cell, you can also use the contents of specified cells in formulas by entering the cell address in the parentheses following the function name. The cell address is a combination of the column letter and the row number. For example, A1 is the cell at the intersection of the first column and the first row.  

A series of cells in a row can be addressed as a range consisting of the first cell and the last cell separated by a colon, such as A1:D1. For example, the formula $=S U M(A i{:}D1)$ totals the values in row 1 of columns A through D. A series of cells in a column can be addressed in the same way. For example, the formula $=S U M(A1{:}A4)$ totals the values in column A of rows 1 through 4. You can also use constants in formulas.  

You can modify a table’s structure in many ways, including the following:  

Insert rows or columns With Word 2019, you can insert a row or column with just one step. Adding multiple rows and columns is also very easy.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Item</td><td>RepairType</td><td>Quantity</td><td>CostinS</td></tr><tr><td>ElastomericDecks</td><td>Resurface</td><td>400 sq.ft.</td><td>1,600</td></tr><tr><td>WoodDecks</td><td>Replace</td><td>1,200 sq.ft.</td><td>6,500</td></tr><tr><td>BuildingExterior</td><td>Repaint</td><td>9,000 sq.ft.</td><td>9,000</td></tr><tr><td>Roof</td><td>Reseal</td><td>5,000 sq.ft.</td><td>2,700</td></tr><tr><td>EntryDoors</td><td>Repaint</td><td>4</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Carpet</td><td>Replace</td><td>150 sq.yds.</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>Intercom</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>2,500</td></tr><tr><td>GarageDoorOpener</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>SteelDoors</td><td>Repaint</td><td>10</td><td>750</td></tr><tr><td>ExteriorTrim</td><td>Repaint</td><td>800 ft.</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>ElevatorHydraulics</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>55,000</td></tr><tr><td>FireAlarmSystem</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>3,000</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td></td><td></td><td>92,650</td></tr></table></body></html>  

 Insert cells You can insert cells in a Word table. When you do, you must specify the direction in which adjacent cells should move to accommodate the new cells.  

Resize an entire table You can easily make a table larger or smaller, maintaining its original aspect ratio if you want.   
 Resize a single column or row You can drag to resize a single column or row. For finer control, you can use the commands in the Cell Size group on the Layout tool tab.   
 Merge and split cells You can merge cells so they span multiple columns or rows. For example, to enter a title for a table in the table’s first row, you could merge the cells in that row to create one merged cell that spans the table’s width. You could then enter the title in the merged cell. For added flair, you could even center the title. In addition to merging multiple cells to create a single cell, you can split a single cell to create multiple cells. When you do, you must specify the number of columns and rows into which you want to split the cell.   
Delete table elements You can delete table elements, including cells, columns, rows, and the entire table, from the Mini Toolbar or the Layout tool tab.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Item</td><td>Repair Type</td><td colspan="2">Quantity</td><td>Costins</td><td colspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td>ElastomericDecks</td><td>R</td><td>Calibri（Bo 11</td><td></td><td>AAE=</td><td rowspan="4">Insert Delete</td><td rowspan="4"></td></tr><tr><td>WoodDecks</td><td>R B</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>BuildingExterior</td><td>R</td><td>IA</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Roof</td><td>Reseal</td><td></td><td>5,00U5q.Tt.</td><td>2,/0U</td></tr><tr><td>EntryDoors</td><td>Repaint</td><td></td><td colspan="2">4</td><td>600</td><td rowspan="2">DeleteCells...

![](images/14d86583eebb3b8ea7b5518f2125bc6d7dfa2e93d41f23f15df1c6726d1732a1.jpg)  

You can control many aspects of a table  

The Table Properties dialog box contains the following tabs:  

Table On the Table tab, you can specify the width of the table and the way it interacts with the surrounding text. You can also access border and shading options, including those for the internal margins of table cells.   
Row On the Row tab, you can specify the height of the selected rows, whether rows can break across pages (when the table is wider than the page), and whether the header row is repeated at the top of each page when a table spans more than one page. Note that the Repeat As Header Row option applies to the entire table rather than the selected row. This option is available only when the cursor is in the top row of the table. Selecting this option helps readers of a document more easily interpret data in multi-page tables. It also allows assistive devices such as screen readers to correctly interpret the table contents.   
Column On the Column tab, you can set the width of each column.   
Cell On the Cell tab, you can set the width of selected cells and the vertical alignment of text within them. Select the Options button on this tab to set the internal margins and text wrapping of individual cells.   
Alt Text On the Alt Text tab, you can enter text that describes the table. Alt text might appear when a table can’t be displayed on the page or when the document is read aloud by an assistive device. Including alt text or a table caption improves the accessibility of the table.  

You can also control cell width, alignment, and margins by using the settings in the Cell Size and Alignment groups on the Layout tool tab.  

# To navigate within a table  

With the cursor in a table cell, do either of the following: Press the Tab key or the arrow keys to move the cursor to the next cell in the row, or from the last cell of a row to the first cell of the next row.  Press Shift $^{+}$ Tab to move the cursor to the previous cell.

# FORMAT TABLES  

Manually formatting a table to best convey its data can be a process of trial and error. With Word 2019, you can quickly get started by applying one of the table styles available in the Table Styles gallery on the Design tool tab. The table styles include a variety of borders, colors, and other attributes that give the table a very professional appearance.  

![](images/3a6ced948845a3d19ede0e1867b1ed8f0aceb00bee44c35c40293eda68dfbbdc.jpg)  

In Word 2019, the Table Styles gallery is divided into sections for plain tables, grid tables, and list tables  

The Table Styles gallery includes three categories of styles:  

Plain Tables These have very little formatting.   
Grid Tables These include vertical separators between columns and horizontal separators between rows.  

An example of a simple grid table   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Item</td><td>RepairType</td><td>Quantity</td><td>CostinS</td></tr><tr><td>ElastomericDecks</td><td>Resurface</td><td>400 sq.ft.</td><td>1,600</td></tr><tr><td>WoodDecks</td><td>Replace</td><td>1,200 sq.ft</td><td>6,500</td></tr><tr><td>BuildingExterior</td><td>Repaint</td><td>9,000 sq.ft.</td><td>9,000</td></tr><tr><td>Roof</td><td>Reseal</td><td>5,000sq.ft.</td><td>2,700</td></tr><tr><td>EntryDoors</td><td>Repaint</td><td>4</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Carpet</td><td>Replace</td><td>150sq.yds.</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>Intercom</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>2,500</td></tr><tr><td>GarageDoorOpener</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>SteelDoors</td><td>Repaint</td><td>10</td><td>750</td></tr><tr><td>ExteriorTrim</td><td>Repaint</td><td>800ft.</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>ElevatorHydraulics</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>55,000</td></tr><tr><td>FireAlarmSystem</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>3,000</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td></td><td></td><td>92,650</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# List Tables These do not include vertical column separators.  

If you want to control the appearance of a table more precisely, you can use the commands on the Design and Layout tool tabs for tables to format the table elements. For example, you can do the following:  

Apply formatting to emphasize the header row and total row.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="4">Item Repair Type Quantity Costins</td></tr><tr><td>ElastomericDecks</td><td>Resurface</td><td>400sq.ft.</td><td>1,600</td></tr><tr><td>WoodDecks</td><td>Replace</td><td>1,200 sq.ft</td><td>6,500</td></tr><tr><td>BuildingExterior</td><td>Repaint</td><td>9,000sq.ft.</td><td>9,000</td></tr><tr><td>Roof</td><td>Reseal</td><td>5,000 sq.ft.</td><td>2,700</td></tr><tr><td>EntryDoors</td><td>Repaint</td><td>4</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Carpet</td><td>Replace</td><td>150sq.yds.</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>Intercom</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>2,500</td></tr><tr><td>GarageDoorOpener</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>SteelDoors</td><td>Repaint</td><td>10</td><td>750</td></tr><tr><td>ExteriorTrim</td><td>Repaint</td><td>800ft.</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>ElevatorHydraulics</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>55,000</td></tr><tr><td>FireAlarmSystem</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>3,000</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td></td><td></td><td>92,650</td></tr></table></body></html>  

You can apply special formatting to emphasize the header and total rows  

Apply formatting to emphasize the first and last columns.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="4">Item RepairType Quantity Costins</td></tr><tr><td>ElastomericDecks</td><td>Resurface</td><td>400sq.ft.</td><td>1,600</td></tr><tr><td>WoodDecks</td><td>Replace</td><td>1,200 sq.ft</td><td>6,500</td></tr><tr><td>BuildingExterior</td><td>Repaint</td><td>9,000sq.ft.</td><td>9,000</td></tr><tr><td>Roof</td><td>Reseal</td><td>5,000 sq.ft.</td><td>2,700</td></tr><tr><td>EntryDoors</td><td>Repaint</td><td>4</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Carpet</td><td>Replace</td><td>150sq.yds.</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>Intercom</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>2,500</td></tr><tr><td>GarageDoorOpener</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>SteelDoors</td><td>Repaint</td><td>10</td><td>750</td></tr><tr><td>ExteriorTrim</td><td>Repaint</td><td>800ft.</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>ElevatorHydraulics</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>55,000</td></tr><tr><td>FireAlarmSystem</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>3,000</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td></td><td></td><td>92,650</td></tr></table></body></html>  

You can also apply special formatting to emphasize the first and last columns in the table  

Apply formatting to the rows or columns so they appear banded.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="4">Item RepairType Quantity Costins</td></tr><tr><td>ElastomericDecks</td><td>Resurface</td><td>400sq.ft.</td><td>1,600</td></tr><tr><td>WoodDecks</td><td>Replace</td><td>1,200 sq.ft</td><td>6,500</td></tr><tr><td>BuildingExterior</td><td>Repaint</td><td>9,000 sq.ft.</td><td>9,000</td></tr><tr><td>Roof</td><td>Reseal</td><td>5,000sq.ft.</td><td>2,700</td></tr><tr><td>Entry Doors</td><td>Repaint</td><td>4</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Carpet</td><td>Replace</td><td>150sq.yds.</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>Intercom</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>2,500</td></tr><tr><td>GarageDoorOpener</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>SteelDoors</td><td>Repaint</td><td>10</td><td>750</td></tr><tr><td>ExteriorTrim</td><td>Repaint</td><td>800ft.</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>Elevator Hydraulics</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>55,000</td></tr><tr><td>FireAlarmSystem</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>3,000</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td></td><td></td><td>92,650</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Applying banding can help to differentiate the text in each row or column  

Apply a border to a cell, row, column, or table.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="4">Item RepairType Quantity Costins</td></tr><tr><td>ElastomericDecks</td><td>Resurface</td><td>400 sq.ft.</td><td>1,600</td></tr><tr><td>WoodDecks</td><td>Replace</td><td>1,200 sq.ft.</td><td>6,500</td></tr><tr><td>BuildingExterior</td><td>Repaint</td><td>9,000 sq.ft.</td><td>9,000</td></tr><tr><td>Roof</td><td>Reseal</td><td>5,000 sq.ft.</td><td>2,700</td></tr><tr><td>EntryDoors</td><td>Repaint</td><td>4</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Carpet</td><td>Replace</td><td>150sq.yds.</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>Intercom</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>2,500</td></tr><tr><td>GarageDoorOpener</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>SteelDoors</td><td>Repaint</td><td>10</td><td>750</td></tr><tr><td>ExteriorTrim</td><td>Repaint</td><td>800ft.</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>ElevatorHydraulics</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>55,000</td></tr><tr><td>FireAlarmSystem</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>3,000</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td></td><td></td><td>92,650</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# A heavy border applied to a row  

Change the shading of a cell, row, or column.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="4">Item RepairType Quantity</td></tr><tr><td>ElastomericDecks</td><td>Resurface</td><td>400sq.ft.</td><td>Costins 1,600</td></tr><tr><td>WoodDecks</td><td>Replace</td><td>1,200 sq.ft.</td><td>6,500</td></tr><tr><td>BuildingExterior</td><td>Repaint</td><td>9,000sq.ft.</td><td>9,000</td></tr><tr><td>Roof</td><td>Reseal</td><td>5,000 sq.ft.</td><td>2,700</td></tr><tr><td>EntryDoors</td><td>Repaint</td><td>4</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Carpet</td><td>Replace</td><td>150sq.yds.</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>Intercom</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>2,500</td></tr><tr><td>GarageDoorOpener</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>SteelDoors</td><td>Repaint</td><td>10</td><td>750</td></tr><tr><td>ExteriorTrim</td><td>Repaint</td><td>800ft.</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>ElevatorHydraulics</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>55,000</td></tr><tr><td>FireAlarmSystem</td><td>Replace</td><td>1</td><td>3,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">TOTAL 92,650</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# Set off specific content by using unique shading  

You can apply character formatting—for example, making text bold or changing the font color—to the text in tables just as you would to regular text: by selecting buttons on the Mini Toolbar and in the Font, Paragraph, and Styles groups on the Home tab.  

# Tip  

If the first row of your table has several long headings that make it difficult to fit the table on one page, you can turn the headings sideways. Simply select the heading row and select the Text Direction button in the Alignment group on the Layout tool tab.  

Quick Tables  

In addition to inserting empty tables, you can insert any of the available Quick Tables, which are predefined tables of formatted data that you can replace with your own information. Built-in Quick Tables include a variety of calendars and simple tables.  

![](images/e4f8eb23a59843e082572f438f31116e14de3b8da88ccd5caab646284b35588c.jpg)

# KEY POINTS  

 To vary the layout of a document, you can divide text into columns. You can control the number of columns, the width of the columns, and the space between the columns. To clearly present a simple set of data, you can use tabs to create a tabbed list, with custom tab stops controlling the width and alignment of columns. You can create a table from scratch or convert existing text to a table. You can control the size of the table and its individual structural elements. By using the built-in table styles, you can quickly apply professional-looking cell and character formatting to a table and its contents. You can enhance a table and its contents by applying text attributes, borders, colors, and shading.

# INSERT, MOVE, AND RESIZE PICTURES  

You can insert digital photographs and images created and saved in other programs into Word documents. Collectively, these types of images are referred to as pictures. You can use pictures to make documents more visually interesting or to convey information in a way that words cannot.  

You can insert a picture into a document either from your computer or from an online source, such as the internet or your cloud storage drive.  

![](images/8e8ff1f33ece697246c8806a3afbaeb4bd96005cb264484d9ec8ac2a3bf23c8b.jpg)  

# Choose an online storage location or search for an image  

After you insert a picture, you can make it larger or smaller and position it anywhere you want on the page. A series of handles around a picture indicates that it is selected and can be moved or edited. A size handle is at each corner and the midpoint of each side. A rotate handle is above the top midpoint of the picture. This tab contains commands for formatting the appearance of a picture and controlling its position relative to text, images, and other page elements.  

![](images/c3ecfe6fe1ea76ece06ad5e706ef064f9e45c23dd8e8ff460f9581af99979244.jpg)  
fteryouinsertapicture,oucanmakeitlarge or smaller and position it anywhere you want on the page.lnserting or selecting a picture activatesits sizinghandles and the Format tooltabin thePictureToolstabgroup.  

By default, Word inserts pictures in line with the text, which means that it increases the line spacing to accommodate the picture. If you enter text adjacent to the picture, the bottom of the picture will align with the bottom of the text on the same line.  

# Tip  

You can move or copy a picture just as you would anything else in Word: by clicking it to select it and then either dragging it where you want it to go (to move it) or holding down the Ctrl key as you drag (to copy it).  

# To insert a picture from your computer  

1. On the Insert tab, in the Illustrations group, select Pictures to open the Insert Picture dialog box.   
2. In the Insert Picture dialog box, browse to and select the picture (or pictures) you want to insert. Then select Insert.  

# Tip  

If a picture might change, you can ensure that the document is always up to date by selecting the Insert arrow and then selecting Link To File to insert a link to the picture, or by selecting Insert and Link to both insert the picture and link it to its graphic file.  

# Graphic formats  

Many common graphic formats store graphics as a series of dots, or pixels. Each pixel is made up of bits. The number of bits per pixel (bpp) determines the number of distinct colors that can be represented by a pixel.  

The mapping of bits to colors isn’t 1:1; it’s 2bpp $(2^{\sim}\mathrm{bpp})$ . In other words:  

$\mathbf{1}\mathbf{b}\mathbf{p}\mathbf{p}=\mathbf{2}$ colors   
$2\mathrm{bpp}=4$ colors   
$4\mathrm{bpp}=16$ colors   
$8\mathrm{bpp}=256\$ colors   
${\bf16\mathrm{bpp}}=65{,}536$ colors   
$32\mathrm{bpp}=4,294,967,296\:$ colors   
64 bpp = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 colors  

Image files that you will use in a Word document are usually in one of the following file formats:  

BMP (bitmap) There are different qualities of BMPs.   
GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) This format is common for images that appear on webpages, because the images can be compressed with no loss of information and groups of them can be animated. GIFs store up to 8 bits per pixel, so they are limited to 256 colors.   
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) This compressed format works well for complex graphics such as scanned photographs. Some information is lost in the compression process, but often the loss is imperceptible to the human eye. Color JPEGs store 24 bits per pixel. Grayscale JPEGs store 8 bits per pixel.  

PNG (Portable Network Graphic) This format has the advantages of the GIF format but can store colors with 24, 32, 48, or 64 bits per pixel and grayscales with 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bits per pixel. A PNG file can also specify whether each pixel blends with its background color and can contain color correction information so that images look accurate on a broad range of display devices. SVG (scalable vector graphics) This format, a recent addition to those supported by Word 2019, stores image data in XML format rather than in pixels. For more information about SVG images, see “Insert and format icons” later in this chapter.  

Of the commonly available file formats, PNG is often the best choice for images other than photographs, because it allows for high-quality images with a small file size and supports transparency.  

# To insert a picture from an online source  

1. On the Insert tab, in the Illustrations group, select Online Pictures. 2. In the Online Pictures window, select an image category or enter a search term in the search box. 3. Browse to and select the picture you want to insert. Then select Insert.

To resize a picture  

 Select the picture, and then do any of the following: To change only the width of the picture, drag the left or right size handle. To change only the height of the picture, drag the top or bottom size handle. To change both the height and the width of the picture without changing its aspect ratio, drag a corner size handle or set the Height or Width measurement in the Sizegroup on the Format tool tab. (Depending on the technique you use to set the measurements, the dimensions might not change until you press Enter or Tab or click away from the measurement entry box.)  

# To position a picture on the page  

1. Select the picture. Then, on the Format tool tab, in the Arrange group, select the Position button to display the available text-wrapping options. 2. Point to a thumbnail to preview where that option will place the picture. 3. Select a thumbnail to move the picture to that location on the page.

# EDIT AND FORMAT PICTURES  

After you insert any picture into a document, you can modify it by using the commands on the Format tool tab. For example, you can do the following:  

 Remove the background by designating the areas you want to keep or remove. Sharpen or soften the picture or change its brightness or contrast. Enhance the picture’s color. Make one of the picture’s colors transparent. Choose an effect, such as Pencil Sketch or Paint Strokes. Apply effects such as shadows, reflections, and borders; or apply combinations of these effects. Add a border consisting of one or more solid or dashed lines of whatever width and color you choose. Rotate the picture to any angle, either by dragging the rotating handle or by choosing a rotating or flipping option. Crop away the parts of the picture that you don’t want to show on the page. (The picture itself is not altered—parts of it are simply covered up.)  

All these changes are made to the representation of the picture on the page and do not affect the original picture.  

The Format tool tab contains the following groups:  

Adjust This group contains commands that you can use to remove the picture’s background, change the picture’s brightness and contrast, recolor it, apply artistic effects to it, and compress it to reduce the size of the document containing it. From this group, you can also change a currently selected picture to a different one.  

![](images/b599ed5c49c1998f5d3fdf1f9a768abf74d5f30e1cb6f88035993d798c8aa985.jpg)  
You can recolor pictures to match your document color theme  

Picture Styles This group offers a wide range of picture styles that you can apply to a picture to change its shape and orientation and to add borders and picture effects.  

Accessibility This group provides tools for adding a description to an image for someone who can’t see or can’t see well, or as an alternative description if the image content is unavailable or unclear. You can describe the image yourself or have Word generate the description for you. You can also indicate whether the image is unimportant to the content and can be skipped by screen-reading software.  

Arrange This group contains commands for specifying the position of the picture on the page with respect to other elements on the page.  

![](images/4de83486598910e58e7c7681e5ab470d87a4c7ea8ab0203db01d9936511dc516.jpg)  

You can control the position of the picture in relation to the surrounding text  


# Tip  

When cropping a picture, be careful not to drag a size handle instead of a crop handle; they’re very close to each other. To redisplay the uncropped picture at any time, select the picture and then select the Crop button.  


# To frame or style a picture  

1. Select the picture. On the Format tool tab, in the Picture Styles group, select the Morebutton to display the Picture Styles gallery.

Use the compression option suitable for your content delivery format  

# Add video content to documents  

Sometimes the best way to ensure that your audience understands your message is to show a video. Although it would be more common to embed a video in a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation than in a Word document, it is possible to do both. For example, you can embed a video recording directly onto a page, and then play the video when displaying the document electronically.  

You can insert a video onto a page from YouTube or from a website that provides an embed code—basically, an address that you can link to.  

# InsertVideo  

![](images/09eb7dd73ad838ded8385b23399c3dd582bf0b5a2b6a7c32850512e23c9b5f2c.jpg)  

# You can insert video clips from a variety of sources  

TIP If a publicly posted video clip has an embed code available, you can link to the online video rather than embedding it in the document. Word uses the embed code to locate and play the video. While the video remains available in its original location (and you have an active internet connection), you will be able to access and play the video from the document at any time.  

After you insert a video, you can format its representation on the page in all the ways that you can with a picture. You can move and resize it, display it in a frame of your choice, and even adjust the brightness or color contrast. The formatting you apply does not display when you  

play the video, however. Instead, the video plays against a gray screen in a frame on top of the Word document in its original format.   
TIP You can add alt text for videos in the Alt Text pane. Word will not automatically generate alt text for videos. For more information about alt text, see the next section, “Provide additional information about pictures.”  

# PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT PICTURES  

Word 2019 has two features that make it easy to provide additional information about images that you insert in your documents. You can provide information about the image; the photographer, artist, or copyright holder; and the image licensing in the form of an attribution. Word 2019 automatically inserts image attributions when you insert an image by using the Online Pictures feature. You can manually insert attributions for pictures that you insert from your computer.  

![](images/0df060175c62a9fdb6c4dbe6bb6352bf4172c75ea11627ec9eec6583ac78fa40.jpg)  
An automatic attribution for an online image with Creative Commons licensing  

The attribution provided for online pictures includes two important hyperlinks. The first is to the picture in its online location so that it can be seen in context. The second is to the applicable licensing information.  

Attributions are provided as normal text within floating text boxes. You can modify the attribution text and move or rotate the text box. When you do, the attribution remains linked to, and part of, the picture object.  

![](images/24e49803f975770139c5df4c810d6db93881fc3638ab0a8c72a96adb20ee639d.jpg)  
A vertical attribution can save space and be less distracting  


# To select an attribution for editing  

 Select the picture. Point to the top of the attribution area (at the bottom of the picture). When the pointer changes to a four-headed arrow, click to select the attribution text box.  

To modify the attribution for an online picture  Select the attribution text box, and then click within the text and edit it.  

To move an online picture attribution  Select the attribution text box, and then drag it to the new location.  

To rotate an online picture attribution  

1. Select the attribution text box, and then drag the rotation handle. 2. Drag the text box size handle to match the text box width to the side of the picture you’re aligning it with.  

To add or edit alt text for a picture  

1. Do either of the following: 1. Select the picture. On the Format tools tab, in the Accessibility group, select Alt Text. 2. Right-click the picture, and then select Edit Alt Text.   
2. In the Alt Text pane, if Word doesn’t generate alt text automatically or accurately, do either of the following:   
0. In the text box, enter text that describes the image and gives it context.   
1. Select Generate a description for me, and then edit the alt text in the text box if you want.  

3. If the image is not important in context, select the Mark as decorative check box.  

# INSERT SCREEN CLIPPINGS  

Many people rely on the web as a source of information. At times, there might be information from the web or another window on your computer that you want to include in a Word document. For example, you might display an image of a page of a client’s website in a sales proposal. Word 2019 includes a screen clipping tool that you can use to capture an image of anything visible on your computer screen and insert the image, called a screen clipping or screenshot, into your document. After you insert a screen clipping into your document, you can format it as you would any other picture.  

There are two ways to insert content displayed on your computer into a Word document:  

 You can insert a screenshot of the content of any open desktop app window.   
 You can capture a screen clipping of any content.  

# Highlights of our itinerary  

![](images/275c79bbd7ad1f6ee882036e9a4ccef9191dfb739a4d600a2de31e183cc52435.jpg)  

Word 2019 makes it easy to insert screen clippings into your documents  

# To insert an image of an on-screen window  

1. Display the window that you want to capture and size it to display its contents as you want to show them.   
2. Switch to Word and position the cursor where you want to insert the screen content.

The selected screen clipping area becomes clear  

When you release the mouse button, Word captures the clipping, restores the window, and inserts the clipping.  

# INSERT AND FORMAT ICONS  

A terrifically useful feature introduced in Office 365, and now available in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, is an extensive icon library. At the time of this writing, the icon library contains approximately 500 icons that you can insert into your Word documents.  

![](images/5b2c48e54ce97ff70fa241da1c09672d6285b125891ce2778461e9af7b52550d.jpg)  

The Office icon library  

The icon library is stored online. This is good, because Microsoft can easily add new icons to it, but not perfect, because it requires an internet connection to use it.  

Provided that you’re online, the icon library is easy to open and browse. The library is not searchable but is divided into categories that make it a bit easier to find what you’re looking for. If you want to enhance your document content with illustrations, it’s worth perusing the icon library before looking elsewhere for these reasons:  

There are no rights or permission issues when using icons from the icon library. The icons provide clear and consistent representations of the image subjects. You can smoothly scale the icons to whatever size you need without worrying about them developing jagged edges.   
You can easily recolor the icons to fit the color scheme of your document.   
You can convert the icons to Office shapes, which allows you to ungroup the icon elements and recolor or otherwise modify them individually.  

![](images/886d912634b47921815252527a5a2b3ce7fab6a4779c6f2640ba60649ad03d22.jpg)  
An icon converted to an Office shape and modified as individual elements  

# To insert an icon  

1. Position the cursor where you want to insert the icon.   
2. On the Insert tab, in the Illustrations group, select Icons.   
3. Scroll through the icon library or select any category in the left pane to move to that section of the library.   
4. Select each icon that you want to insert. You can select as many icons as you want. A check mark appears in the corner of each selected icon.   
5. Select Insert to insert the selected icon or icons as individual pictures.  

Work with scalable vector graphics  

Word 2019 supports scalable vector graphics (SVG images), which sound fancy (and in fact, are) but can be used quite easily within Word 2019 and other Office 2019 apps by people who aren’t professional graphic artists.  

The icons provided with Word and other apps in the Office 2019 suite are scalable vector graphics. This file type might not be familiar to Word users (although it will quickly become more commonly known now that Word supports it). Vector graphicsare composed of shapes, rather than pixels, which means that as you increase or decrease their size (scale them), their edges remain smooth rather than becoming pixelated, as the edges of the more commonly used GIF, JPG, and PNG image types do. In other words, they look just as good at 1,000 percent as they do at 100 percent.  

Scalability is only one cool feature of SVG images. Another is that, rather than being simply a picture, the content of an SVG image is defined in XML format within the file and can be transformed, animated, and otherwise modified by using scripts and cascading style sheets (CSS files), or simply by selecting the image and recoloring it within Word or another Office 2019 app.  

# To convert an icon to an Office shape  

1. Do either of the following:  

1. Select the icon. On the Format tool tab, in the Change group, click Convert to Shape. 2. Right-click the icon, and then select Convert to Shape.  

2. In the Microsoft Word message box prompting you to confirm that you want to convert the icon to a Microsoft Office drawing object, select Yes.  

To resize, recolor, rotate, or otherwise modify an icon  

Select the icon, and then use the standard tools on the Format tool tab to modify it as you would any other picture object.  

# DRAW AND MODIFY SHAPES  

Word has an extensive library of shapes. Shapes can be simple, such as lines, circles, or squares; or more complex, such as stars, hearts, and arrows. Some shapes are three-dimensional (although most are two-dimensional). Some of these shapes have innate meanings or intentions, and others are simply shapes.  

![](images/3b515f7727383979314e7380788d104f1050d850d3c2f3dedf18b114cd076e16.jpg)  

The shapes you can insert in a Word document  

Shapes are available from the Shapes gallery. Pointing to any shape in the Shapes gallery displays a ScreenTip that contains the shape name.  

# Draw and add text to shapes  

After you select a shape that you want to add to your document, you click or tap the page to insert it at its default size or drag to draw the shape at the size you want it on the page. Shapes are also text boxes, and you can enter text directly into them. You can format the text in shapes just as you would regular text.  

![](images/b91fd2fe8562bfef6dfcd070b5deaa0847a2623a30c29756b7729355b319c06b.jpg)  

Shapes can help to visually reinforce a concept  

# Use the drawing canvas to draw shapes  

If your picture consists of more than a few shapes, you might want to draw the shapes on a drawing canvas instead of directly on the page. The drawing canvas keeps the parts of the picture together, helps you position the picture, and provides a frame-like boundary between your picture and the text on the page. To open a drawing canvas, you select New Drawing Canvas at the bottom of the Shapes menu. You can then draw shapes on the canvas in the usual ways. You can resize and move the drawing canvas and the shapes on it as one unit.  

If you prefer to always use the drawing canvas when creating pictures with shapes, do the following:  

1. Display the Backstage view, select Options, and in the Word Options dialog box, select Advanced.   
2. On the Advanced page, in the Editing Options area, select the Automatically create drawing canvas when inserting AutoShapes check box, and select OK.  

To create a shape on a page  

1. On the Insert tab, in the Illustrations group, select the Shapes button.   
2. On the Shapes menu, select the shape you want to insert.  

# Tip  

If you select a shape button and then change your mind about drawing the shape, you can release the selection by pressing the Esc key.  

3. When the cursor changes to a plus sign, do either of the following:  

1. Click on the page to create a shape of the default size. 2. Drag diagonally on the page to specify the upper-left and lower-right corners of the rectangle that surrounds the shape (the drawing canvas).  

# Tip  

To draw a shape that has the same height and width (such as a circle or square), hold down the Shift key while you drag.  

# To add text to a shape  

Select the shape, and then enter the text you want to display on the shape. There is no cursor to indicate the location of the text; when you start typing, it appears on the shape.  

# Locate additional formatting commands  

You control the area of the shape that is available for text by formatting the Text Box margins of the shape. This setting is gathered with many others in the Format Shape pane, which you can display by selecting the Shape Styles or WordArt Styles dialog box launcher on the Format tool tab. You can display different pages of settings by selecting the icons at the top of the pane.  

In Word 2019, the most frequently used formatting commands are located on the ribbon. If additional commands are available, the ribbon group includes a dialog box launcher. Selecting the dialog box launcher displays either a dialog box or a control pane.  

# Move and modify shapes  

You can change the size, angles, and effects applied to shapes. You can apply different colors to the outline and inside (fill) of a shape.  

When you first draw a shape, and any time you select it thereafter, a set of handles appears around the shape.  

![](images/e132ec3df5e0057b4e189598786e719cde21b2bfdfa430444a15025e9250a37d.jpg)  

You can easily modify the shape, size, and angle of an image  

You can use the handles to manipulate the shape in the following ways:  

Drag the side or corner handles (hollow circles) to change the size or aspect ratio of the shape. Drag the angle handles (yellow circles) to change the angles or curves of the shape. (Note that not all shapes have angle handles.)   
 Drag the rotate handle (circling arrow) to rotate the shape.  

With a little imagination, you can combine shapes to create more complex images.  

![](images/512c9704adbc082cd151abad0baccc541c72452abf383a639a17f3ecbe3312f3.jpg)  

Nine shapes arranged to create a recognizable image  

To select a shape for editing  

Click the shape once.  

To select multiple shapes  

 Select a shape, hold down the Shift or Ctrl key, and select each of the remaining shapes. Select one or more paragraphs to select all the shapes that are anchored to those paragraphs. (Note that this method doesn’t activate the Format tool tab, but you can copy, cut, or delete the anchor paragraphs and associated shapes.)  

To resize a shape  

Select the shape, and then do any of the following: To change only the width of the shape, drag the left or right size handle. To change only the height of the shape, drag the top or bottom size handle. To change both the height and the width of the shape, drag a corner size handle. To resize a shape without changing its aspect ratio, hold down the Shift key and drag a corner size handle or press an arrow key.  

To rotate or flip a shape  

1. Select the shape.  

2. On the Format tool tab, in the Arrange group, select the Rotate Objects button.  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>RotateRight90° RotateLeft90°</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>FlipVertical</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>FlipHorizontal</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>More Rotation Options..</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The menu illustrates the rotate and flip options  

3. On the Rotate Objects menu, do either of the following:  

1. Select the Rotate or Flip option you want.   
2. Select More Rotation, enter or select a specific angle of rotation in the Rotationbox on the Size tab of the Layout dialog box, and then select OK.  

# Tip  

You can rotate or flip any type of image. Rotating turns a shape 90 degrees to the right or left;   
flipping turns a shape 180 degrees horizontally or vertically.  


# Format shapes  

When a shape is selected, the Format tool tab in the Drawing Tools tab group appears on the ribbon. You can use the commands on the Format tool tab to do the following:  

Replace the shape with another without changing the formatting. Change the fill and outline colors of the shape, and the effects applied to the shape. Separately, change the fill and outline colors and effects of any text that you add to the shape.   
 Arrange, layer, and group multiple shapes.  

Having made changes to one shape, you can easily apply the same attributes to another shape, or you can apply the attributes to all future shapes you draw.  

![](images/496ff0f6cbeb3b1c18452bbf3943b20da1d72a08295e095f699a38ecb9db2375.jpg)  

When you have multiple shapes on a page, you can group them so that you can copy, move, and format them as a unit. You can change the attributes of an individual shape—for example, its color, size, or location—without ungrouping the shapes.  

# To format a shape  

1. Select the shape that you want to format.   
2. On the Format tool tab, in the Shape Styles group, select the More button to display the Shape Styles gallery.   
3. Point to any thumbnail to display a live preview of the formatting applied to the picture.   
4. Select a thumbnail to apply the corresponding style.  

![](images/b5116ec9a0343356f9d0d007f7ea91dff394f01262541cc08de6204672dfcf92.jpg)  
The Shape Styles gallery color options reflect the current color scheme  

To format text on a shape  

1. Select the shape.   
2. On the Format tool tab, in the WordArt Styles group, modify the style, text fill, text outline, or text effects.  


# Insert symbols  

Some documents require characters not found on a standard keyboard. These characters might include the copyright $\left(\copyright)$ or registered trademark $(\textsuperscript{\_}{\textregistered})$ symbols, currency symbols (such as $\mathbf{\epsilon}_{\mathbf{{{\epsilon}}}}$ or £), Greek letters, or letters with accent marks. Or you might want to add arrows (such as ${\pmb{\pi}}_{\mathrm{or}}{\pmb{\pi}}_{\mathrm{-}}$ ) or graphic icons (such as $\Re_{\mathrm{or}}\twoheadrightarrow$ ).  

Like graphics or shapes, symbols can add visual information or eye appeal to a document. However, they differ from graphics in that they are characters associated with a particular font.  

Word gives you easy access to a huge array of symbols that you can easily insert into any document. To insert a recently used symbol:  

1. On the Insert tab, in the Symbols group, select the Symbol button to display a list of recently used symbols.   
2. Select a symbol in the list to insert it in your document.   
3. If the symbol you need does not appear in the list, select More Symbols to open the Symbol dialog box.  

![](images/4ef7cb816d118005fb4085a5496cfcf96b3a820c205226a186bc6e5d1e8027a0.jpg)  
The Symbol dialog box offers easy access to hundreds of symbols  

4. Click the symbol to select it, and then select the Insert button.   
5. Select the Close button to close the Symbol dialog box.  

You can also insert some common symbols by typing a key combination. For example, if you enter two consecutive dashes followed by a word and a space, Word automatically changes the two dashes to a professional-looking em-dash $(-)$ . (This symbol gets its name from the fact that it was originally the width of the capital letter $M.$ ) These key combinations are controlled by the AutoCorrect feature. For information about displaying and modifying AutoCorrect options, see Chapter 16, “Customize options and the user interface.”  

You can review many of the available shortcuts for inserting frequently used symbols on the Special Characters page of the Symbol dialog box.  

# To copy formatting from one shape to another  

1. Select the shape from which you want to copy the formatting.  

2. On the Home tab, in the Clipboard group, select the Format Painter button. 3. Select the shape you want to copy the formatting to.  

To set formatting as the default for the active document  

Right-click the formatting source shape, and then select Set as Default Shape.  

# Tip  

The Set As Default Shape command doesn’t actually set a default shape; it sets only the default shape formatting.  

To group shapes together as one object  

1. Select all the shapes that you want grouped together.   
2. On the Format tool tab, in the Arrange group, select the Group button (when you point to this button, the ScreenTip that appears says Group Objects) and then, in the list, select Group.  

![](images/b506f45a4ed1d18d49643138ff2dfbad58ca86b1e5d7f4ee6b96eded10869a8a.jpg)  

Grouped objects have a common set of handles  

# To move an entire group  

1. Point to any shape in the group.   
2. When the pointer changes to a four-headed arrow, drag the group to the new location.  

To ungroup shapes  

1. Select the group.   
2. On the Format tool tab, in the Arrange group, select the Group button, and then select Ungroup.  

# BUILD EQUATIONS  

You can insert mathematical symbols, such as $\pi$ (pi) or $\Sigma$ (sigma, or summation), the same way you would insert any other symbol. But you can also create entire mathematical equations in a document. You can insert some predefined equations, including the quadratic formula, the binomial theorem, and the Pythagorean theorem, into a document with a few clicks. If you need something other than these standard equations, you can build your own equations by using a library of mathematical symbols.  

Equations are different from graphics in that they are accurately rendered mathematical formulas that appear in the document as fields. However, they are similar to graphics in that they can be displayed in line with the surrounding text or in their own space with text above and below them.  

You can insert equations in two ways:  

By inserting a predefined equation The Insert New Equation gallery contains several commonly used equations, including the following:   
 Area of circle   
 Binomial theorem Expansion of a sum   
 Fourier series Pythagorean theorem   
 Quadratic formula Taylor expansion   
. Trig identity 1 Trig identity 2 You can insert an equation from the gallery, or you can search the Office.com site for other predefined equations. By building an equation from scratch Selecting the Equation button instead of its arrow inserts a field in which you can build an equation from scratch.  

When you opt to build an equation from scratch, Word displays the Design tool tab for equations. This tab provides access to mathematical symbols and structures such as fractions, scripts, radicals, integrals, and more.  

![](images/450d5cd77653c12e39c2e1471333e80f88e6b45a29711c023deea0efb05d2932.jpg)  

The Design tool tab for equations offers easy access to mathematical symbols and structures  

Selecting a button on the Design tool tab—for example, the Fraction button—displays a gallery of related structures.  

![](images/0c98937e830ef943356fe47dffa7e2074a04e58c07caf6eb2215d27a2c099fc1.jpg)  
The Fraction gallery provides structures for forming fractions  

By default, equations appear in professional, or two-dimensional, form. If you prefer linear form, which is easier to edit, you can easily change the equation accordingly. You can also specify how the equation should be aligned on the page—left, right, or center.  

For even finer control over the equations you build, you can open the Equation Options dialog box by selecting the Conversions dialog box launcher on the Design tool tab. Here, you can set many options that govern the appearance of equation expressions in a document, such as the following:  

The size of nested fractions   
The placement of integral limits   
The placement of $n$ -ary limits   
The alignment of the equation   
The treatment of wrapped lines in the equation  

![](images/6aec6b7868b067afe25976ee3c473658e14d74110423eb2cdf5bce45d2dcbc04.jpg)  
You can fine-tune the appearance of equation expressions in a document  

If you build an equation that you know you will want to reuse later, you can save it. When you save an equation, Word stores it as a building block. You can name the equation whatever you like. You can then access the equation from the Equation gallery, with other predefined equations.  

![](images/1c9a4afc67e872aa2be31acafb868264d99a88094a3415dd45f706de85963d76.jpg)  


# To build an equation  

1. On the Insert tab, in the Symbols group, select Equation to insert an equation field into the document.  

![](images/13a463fa21284d561db5e1a9bc9af2c8b6b8eea7b543b7e051c0c03a6c5d6df4.jpg)  

Word inserts a field in which you can build an equation  

2. Enter an equation in the equation field. To change the equation to linear form  

1. Click the equation to select it.  

2. Do either of the following:  

1. On the Design tool tab, in the Conversions group, select Convert, and then in the Equation Options list, select Current-Linear.  

2. Select the arrow to the right of the equation, and then select Linear in the list that appears.  

To change the relationship of the equation with the text  

To display the equation in line with the text rather than on its own line (the default), in the Equation Options list, select Change to Inline. If the equation is already displayed in line with the text and you want to set it apart on its own line, in the Equation Options list, select Change to Display.  

To change the alignment of the equation  

In the Equation Options list, select Justification, and then select the alignment option you want (Left, Right, Centered, or Centered as Group).  

# Tip  

You can change the font, size, and other attributes of the equation as you would any other type of text element. Simply select the equation, right-click the selection, and choose Font from the menu that appears. The Font dialog box opens; change the settings as you want.  

To save an equation  

1. Select the equation.   
2. In the Equation Options list, select Save as New Equation to open the Create New Building Block dialog box.   
3. In the Name box, replace the equation with a name you’ll remember, and then select OK.  

# KEY POINTS  

You can use digital photographs and images created and saved in other programs to make documents more visually interesting or to convey information in a way that words cannot. You can include information from your computer screen in a document by capturing and inserting screenshots and screen clippings directly from within the document. You can add decorative elements or build complex illustrations within Word by using shapes and icons. Word has equation building tools that make it easy to build correctly formatted mathematical equations in a document.  

![](images/fd55bd0b7fcd82802bafd93cbc7b1c85bba29e3ea50aa98492c25b146d95e1b3.jpg)  


# Draw and modify shapes  

Open a new blank document in Print Layout view, and then perform the following tasks:  

1. In the upper-left corner of the page, from the Block Arrows section of the Shapesmenu, insert an Arrow: Curved Right shape.   
2. Change the shape’s Height setting to 3” and its Width setting to $\mathbf{2}^{\mathfrak{s}}$ .   
3. Create a copy of the shape and move the copy to the upper-right corner of the page.   
4. Flip the copy of the shape horizontally so it is a mirror image of the first shape.   
5. From the Rectangles section of the Shapes menu, insert a Rectangle shape and move it so that its lower corners align with the points of each arrow. (You might have to adjust the size and position of the rectangle and the position of the arrows.)   
6. In the rectangle, enter What goes around comes around.   
7. Change the font of the text to Century Gothic, the size to 18 points, and the color to Dark Blue.   
8. Group all the shapes as one object.   
9. From the Theme Styles section of the Shape Styles gallery, apply the Subtle Effect – Gold, Accent 4 style to the grouped object. (This is the fourth option in the column of gold effects.)   
10. Ungroup the shapes.   
11. Save the document in the practice file folder as MyShapes, and then close it.  

# Build equations  

Create a new document in Word, and then perform the following tasks:  

1. With the cursor in the first line of the document, insert the Pythagorean theorem predefined equation.   
2. On the next line, insert a blank equation field.   
3. In the equation field, enter (p-3)\*.   
4. Display the Fraction gallery and select the first thumbnail in the first row (Stacked Fraction) to insert structured placeholders for a simple fraction in the equation field.   
5. Enter b in the top box of the fraction structure and enter 3 in the bottom box.   
6. Change the equation to linear form.   
7. Save the equation as a building block named Additional People Cost.   
8. Display the Insert an Equation gallery. The equation you saved appears near the bottom of the gallery.   
9. Save and close the document.  


# CREATE DIAGRAMS  

Sometimes the concepts you want to convey to an audience are best presented in diagrams. You can easily create a dynamic, appealing diagram by using SmartArt graphics, which visually express information in predefined sets of shapes. You can use SmartArt graphics to easily create sophisticated diagrams that illustrate the following concepts:  

List These diagrams visually represent lists of related or independent   
information—for example, a list of items needed to complete a task, including pictures of the items.   
Process These diagrams visually describe the ordered set of steps required to complete a task—for example, the steps for getting a project approved. Cycle These diagrams represent a circular sequence of steps, tasks, or events, or the relationship of a set of steps, tasks, or events to a central, core element— for example, the looping process for continually improving a product based on customer feedback.   
Hierarchy These diagrams illustrate the structure of an organization or entity—for example, the top-level management structure of a company.   
Relationship These diagrams show convergent, divergent, overlapping, merging, or containment elements—for example, how using similar methods to organize your email, calendar, and contacts can improve your productivity.   
Matrix These diagrams show the relationship of components to a whole—for example, the product teams in a department. Pyramid These diagrams illustrate proportional or interconnected relationships—for example, the amount of time that should ideally be spent on different phases of a project.  

The layout of content in a SmartArt diagram is controlled by a behind-the-scenes bulleted list. When creating a SmartArt diagram in Word, you choose a layout first, and then populate the associated list in a window called the Text pane.  

The dialog box from which you choose the SmartArt graphic layout displays monochromatic representations of the layouts; this is only so the colors don’t confuse the process of choosing a layout. The actual colors of the SmartArt diagram are based on the color scheme of the document, and you can choose from several different color patterns. The categories in the left pane of the dialog box are not mutually exclusive, so some diagrams appear in more than one category.  

![](images/47413c544da82e7bf097a5ec2feddc06fb334d96c50ac7da04d3641478cf5af4.jpg)  

# Tip  

After you create a SmartArt diagram, you can change its content, layout, and colors. For information about changing the diagram colors, see “Modify diagrams” later in this chapter.  

Selecting a layout in the Choose A SmartArt Graphic dialog box displays a color mockup of the diagram and information about any restrictions on the number of entries or list levels the layout supports.  

You can find the layout information in the Text pane after you create the diagram. Sometimes the Text pane displays the layout name and description at the bottom; other times, it displays only the layout name. When this is the case, simply point to the layout name to display the layout description in a ScreenTip.  

![](images/7e852bf9a9d057483777dc7e58268abb7b15c32adf226256c16fe9ed8734ff0d.jpg)  
The detailed description of the selected SmartArt diagram can help you choose the right diagram for your needs  

After you choose a layout, Word inserts the basic diagram into the document and displays the Text pane containing placeholder information. You can enter more or less information than is required by the original diagram.  

![](images/8ced0304d5f5424daea63fb34a0cd7a57857d25cae643f8d82eb20b7fba0c214.jpg)  
When you enter text in either the Text pane or the selected shape, that text also appears in the other location  

You can insert and modify text either directly in the diagram shapes or in the associated Text pane. (You can hide the Text pane when you’re not using it, and redisplay it if you need it.) The Text pane might display only a single-level bulleted list, or a multilevel list if the diagram layout supports multiple levels. You can expand the diagram either by adding more list items or by adding more shapes. Some diagram layouts support a specific number of entries and others can be expanded significantly.  

![](images/1e33ac270de32bc8af91a040645094d3a14636a583d3c41acbed05e1c5edb004.jpg)  

You can increase or decrease the number of items displayed by a diagram to convey a more precise message  

In layouts that support additional entries, Word adds shapes to the diagram to accommodate the content. Within a diagram, shapes of the same hierarchy level are the same size regardless of the amount of content each contains. The text within the shapes is also the same size. If a text entry is too long to fit a shape, the text size changes in all the shapes at that hierarchy level.  

![](images/fb2f5f4a6682ccace16174ff6763f60cc7dd426e0b4629615b2f339a925140d0.jpg)  

Word keeps your SmartArt diagrams looking professional by automatically adjusting text size as needed  

# Tip  

You can move, resize, and wrap text around SmartArt graphics just as you can other types of images. For information about configuring image layout options, see “Arrange objects on a page” in Chapter 10, “Organize and arrange content.”  

# To create a diagram in a document

You can use the Text pane both to easily enter text and to quickly review your text for errors  

# Tip  

For a clean look, don’t use ending punctuation for the text that appears in the SmartArt graphic shapes.  

4. In the Text pane, select the Close button (the X).  

# MODIFY DIAGRAMS  

After you create a diagram and add the text you want to display in it, you can move and size it to fit the space, and format it to achieve professional-looking results.  

If the diagram layout you originally selected doesn’t precisely meet your needs, you can easily change to a different layout. Some layouts preserve information that doesn’t fit, and others don’t; a message at the bottom of the Text pane provides information so you can make an informed decision.  

![](images/8b00186924bd096fdbc61ebf8756caf9480ee9b99be0d2183df56cf79a366a82.jpg)  
Some diagrams support only a limited number of text entries  

When a SmartArt graphic is active, the SmartArt Tools tab group on the ribbon includes two tabs: Design and Format.  

![](images/b925c899f274939a309a52b6c1c284a018986539129f82c34a4cad6d294cc54b.jpg)  

# The Design tool tab for SmartArt graphics  

You can make many changes directly on the diagram canvas, but if you prefer, you can also make changes from the ribbon. From the Design tool tab, you can make changes such as the following:  

Add, move, and change the hierarchy of shapes.   
Change to a different layout.   
Change the color scheme of the diagram.   
Change the effects applied to the diagram shapes.   
Reset the diagram to its default settings.  

![](images/baae06facefc4c64cee63d9ad0cf64796b3a5b1c8f41635576b417c1e10280d0.jpg)  

# The Format tool tab for SmartArt graphics  

From the Format tool tab, you can make changes such as the following:  

Change the shape of an individual diagram shape—for example, change a square to a star to make it stand out. Change the size of an individual diagram shape. Apply a built-in shape style. Apply colors and effects to specific shapes. Apply WordArt text effects to the text in a shape. Add text alternatives (alt text) to the diagram.  Position and resize the SmartArt graphic.  

To add a shape to a SmartArt graphic  

1. Select the diagram and open the Text pane.   
2. At the end of any list item, press Enter to add an item to the bulleted list at the same level and a corresponding shape to the diagram.   
3. If you want to make the new item a subitem of the original item, press Tab to demote the bulleted list item and change the corresponding shape.  


# Tip  

For a custom WordArt effect, you can select the text fill color, the text outline color, and the text effect individually from the corresponding menus in the WordArt Styles group.  

# CREATE PICTURE DIAGRAMS  

Most SmartArt graphics present text information in shapes, but some can display pictures instead of, or in addition to, text. Most SmartArt graphic categories include some picture options, but picture diagrams are also available in their own category to help you locate them if you specifically want to create a diagram that includes pictures.  

![](images/1e57b7d6854b993892d230aa0709ca596a51870d8f89c12f3defb94192f4411e.jpg)  

Diagrams that include spaces for pictures have “Picture” in the layout name  

You can insert pictures into a SmartArt graphic from the same sources you can insert them into a document from: your computer or a connected storage location, a SharePoint library, a OneDrive or OneDrive for Business storage folder, or the internet. As always, take care when reusing pictures you find on the internet to ensure that you don’t violate someone’s copyright.  

When you insert or select a picture in a SmartArt graphic, the SmartArt Tools tab group and the Picture Tools tab group are active. You can edit pictures you insert in diagrams the same way you edit those you insert directly into documents.  

![](images/d028d0fe82aac8ec29c64367658b44983c1ff67104fdb788ae3a0c20f9e17633.jpg)  

You can magnify the picture within the diagram space, remove the picture background, or apply an artistic effect

Word 2019 includes the ability to insert, manipulate, and format three-dimensional models in your documents.  

![](images/73e326c124d61cc6f76ad8900066c21858077709881c87d8062322b2cc58dc5b.jpg)  

3D models depict a chicken selecting a treat from a cornucopia  

# Insert 3D models  

You can select models from the Remix 3D online library or another source, or create your own in Microsoft Paint 3D. Supported 3D model file types include:  

3D Manufacturing Format (\*.3mf)  

Binary GL Transmission Format (\*.glb)   
Filmbox Format (\*.fbx)   
Object Format (\*.obj)   
Polygon Format (\*.ply)   
StereoLithography Format (\*.stl)  

Access to the Remix 3D library is free. The library includes a wide variety of objects in categories as diverse as Dinosaurs, Space, and Dioramas—and if you don’t find what you need, you can create your own by using Microsoft Paint 3D.  

# Online3DModels  

![](images/447791591fc8cc62d83f0ade5bfa21da1c65bd88a70368ec0678d5267806074f.jpg)  
The Remix 3D online library is available from Office and Paint 3D  

Some of the 3D models available from the Remix 3D library are animated. Animated models are obviously effective only when you display them on-screen—in a PowerPoint slide show or electronically distributed document—rather than in a printed Word document.  

![](images/011b1a42254d3cbfbc7f608a620c1135c71ae2cd57bb96534805549ba62b200e.jpg)  

Animated models are indicated by a running person  

To insert a 3D model from the online library  

1. On the Insert tab, in the Illustrations group, select 3D Models (or select the 3D Models arrow, and then select From Online Sources).   
2. In the Online 3D Models window, do either of the following:   
1. Enter a search term in the search box, and then press Enter to display related models. Select a category tile to display models in that category.   
3. Locate the model you want to insert, select the tile, and then select Insert.  

To insert a 3D model from a local file  

1. On the Insert tab, in the Illustrations group, select the 3D Models arrow (not the button), and then select From a File. The Insert 3D Model dialog box opens to your 3D Objects folder. This is the default folder for saving three-dimensional models from Paint 3D.   
2. In the Insert 3D Model dialog box, browse to the file you want to insert, and then select Insert.  

# Modify 3D models  

Commands for working with 3D models are available from the Format tool tab that appears when a 3D model is selected.  

![](images/6c6ffab3a0d2230a2110e396ddc4048ecadb73e1a3e951c619231f3d70c5c7d2.jpg)  
The Play 3D group appears only for animated models  

The primary actions you take with 3D models are rotating and tilting the model to change the viewer’s perspective of the model, and then panning and zooming to change the display of the model on the drawing board. Selecting a three-dimensional model displays additional handles you can use for these actions.  

Animated 3D models have one or more associated motion patterns. The available motion patterns are called scenes. Some animated models have only one scene (for example, the animated toaster shows toast popping out of the toaster). Others have multiple scenes. The available motion patterns for each model are labeled Scene 1, Scene 2, and so on. The motion associated with each scene is specific to the model. If a 3D model has multiple motion pattern scenes, you can easily switch among them.  

![](images/f3f5afcf7aac5faf9a9293b6e5a5a770adf29387b32cbba387fbbb074f5e7167.jpg)  
Handles that are specific to 3D model actions  

You can choose from a preset view or rotate the model freely. Preset views include Front, Back, Left, Right, Top, Bottom, and combinations such as Above Back Left.

# CREATE CHARTS  

You can easily add a chart to a document to help identify trends that might not be obvious from looking at numbers. Word 2019 has 17 chart categories. Some categories include two-dimensional and three-dimensional variations. The Map and Funnel categories are new to the Microsoft Office apps in Office 2019.  

![](images/66e2b5dc483a9fc1f4c955d19e1efa355628afc0534aebc1c7bc4ea40f2d0bde.jpg)  

In the Insert Chart dialog box, you can choose from many types of charts  

The most frequently used chart categories include:  

 Column These charts show how values change over time. Line These charts show erratic changes in values over time. Pie These charts show how parts relate to the whole.  

![](images/094674ce83115cb8e989d9e71183bab8a68db86f074afce7dd201abf795a0b79.jpg)  



# The worksheet title bar identifies it as specific to the chart  

You can enter the data directly into the linked worksheet, or you can copy and paste it from an existing Microsoft Access table, Word table, or Excel worksheet.  

After you plot the data in the chart, you can move and size the chart to fit the space available on the page, change the flow of text around the chart, and add and remove chart elements to most clearly define the chart content for the audience. You can edit the data in the worksheet at any time—both the values and the column and row headings. Word replots the chart to reflect your changes.  

When a chart is active, you can work with the chart and its components by using commands from the Design and Format tool tabs on the ribbon, and the Chart Elements, Chart Styles, and Chart Filters panes that open when you select the corresponding buttons to the right of the chart. The Layout Options button is also available.  

# Tip  

The Chart Filters button appears only if it is appropriate for the active chart.  

![](images/3cee055eba69837edae886700f86d08e0b42939a377a6aa0325a97d85a8a3bda.jpg)  
Manage a chart from the ribbon or from option panes  

If you decide that the type of chart you initially selected doesn’t adequately depict your data, you can change the type at any time.  

# To create a chart on a page  

1. On the Insert tab, in the Illustrations group, select the Chart button.   
2. In the left pane of the Insert Chart dialog box, select a chart category to display the chart variations in the right pane.   
3. In the right pane, select the chart type that you want to create, and then select OK to insert a sample chart and open its associated Excel worksheet containing the plotted data.   
4. In the linked Excel worksheet, enter the values to be plotted, following the pattern of the sample data.  

# Tip  

If the data you want to plot on the chart already exists in another file, you can save time by reusing it. Set up the chart structure in the linked worksheet first, and then paste the existing data into the linked worksheet.  

5. If the chart data range defined by the colored outlines doesn’t automatically expand to include new data, drag the blue handle in the lower-right corner of the range to expand it.  

6. Close the Excel window.  

To insert a chart from Excel onto a page  

1. In the source workbook, click the chart border to select it.   
2. Copy the chart to the Clipboard.   
3. Switch to Word, display the page, and then paste the chart from the Clipboard.  

To change the type of a selected chart  

1. On the Design tool tab, in the Type group, select Change Chart Type.  

2. In the Change Chart Type dialog box, select a category on the left and a chart type at the top, and then select OK.  

# Tip  

When you click a chart type in the top row, the dialog box displays a preview of that chart type as applied to the current data. You can point to the preview to display a larger version.  

# Custom chart templates  

If you make extensive modifications to the design of a chart, you might want to save it as a template. Then when you want to plot similar data in the future, you can apply the template as a custom chart type instead of manually making the changes.  

To save a customized chart as a template, follow these steps:  

1. Select the chart (not a chart element).   
2. Right-click the chart, and then select Save as Template to open the Save Chart Template dialog box displaying the contents of your Charts folder. TIP The default Charts folder is the AppData\Roaming\Microsoft \Templates\Charts subfolder of your user profile folder.  

3. Enter a name for the chart template in the File name box, and then select Save.  

You can work with custom chart templates in the following ways:  

To locate a custom chart type, open the Chart Type or Change Chart Typedialog box, and then select Templates.   
To delete a custom chart type, display the Templates folder in the Chart   
Typeor Change Chart Type dialog box. In the lower-left corner, select Manage Templates. Then, in the File Explorer window that opens, right-click the template and select Delete.  

# MODIFY CHARTS  

You can modify a chart by changing the data or elements that it displays.  

# Manage chart data  

The Excel worksheet is composed of rows and columns of cells that contain values, which in charting terminology are called data points. Collectively, a set of data points is called a data series. Each worksheet cell is identified by an address consisting of its column letter and row number—for example, A2. A range of cells is identified by the address of the cell in the upper-left corner and the address of the cell in the lowerright corner, separated by a colon—for example, A2:D5.  

By default, a chart is plotted based on the series of data points in the columns of the attached worksheet, and these series are identified in the legend. You can easily switch the chart to base it on the series in the rows instead, or you can select specific cells of the worksheet data to include in the chart.  

You can edit the chart data at any time, either in the linked worksheet window or in Excel. The ribbon is available only when you open the worksheet in Excel.  

To select a chart for editing  

1. Point to a blank area of the chart, outside of the plot area.   
2. When the Chart Area ScreenTip appears, click once.  

To open the linked chart data worksheet in Word  

Right-click the chart, and then select Edit Data.   
Select the chart. Then on the Design tool tab, in the Data group, select the Edit Databutton (not the arrow).  

# Tip  

The chart must be active (surrounded by a frame) when you make changes to the data in the worksheet; otherwise, the chart won’t automatically update.  

To open the linked chart data worksheet in Excel  

1. Select the chart.   
2. On the Design tool tab, in the Data group, select the Edit Data arrow, and then select Edit Data in Excel.

To switch the data across the category and series axes  

1. Open the linked chart data worksheet.   
2. In Word, on the Design tool tab, in the Data group, select the Switch Row/Columnbutton.  

# Tip  

The Switch Row/Column button is active only when the linked worksheet is open.  

To select worksheet data for editing  To select a cell, click it. To select a column, click the column header (the letter at the top of the column). To select a row, click the row header (the number at the left end of the row). To select multiple cells, columns, or rows, do either of the following: Select the first element, and then hold down the Shift key as you select subsequent elements. Drag through adjacent cells, columns, or rows. To select an entire worksheet, select the Select All button (the triangle in the upper-left corner of the worksheet, at the intersection of the row and column headers).

Filtering a chart to display only specific series and categories  

5. Select the Chart Filters button to close the Chart Filters pane.  


# Modify the display of chart elements  

Each data point in a data series is represented graphically in the chart by a data marker. The data is plotted against an x-axis (referred to as the horizontal axis or category axis) and a y-axis (referred to as the vertical axis or value axis). (Three-dimensional charts also have a z-axis, which is referred to as the depth axis or series axis.)  

The primary components of a chart on a page include the following:  

Chart area The entire area within the chart frame.   
Plot area The rectangular area bordered by the axes.   
Data markers Graphical representations of the values, or data points, of each data series in the linked worksheet.  

You can add chart elements to the chart components to help explain the data.  

![](images/fc8ccb17a5ba7d67e7d0e2c3542d84e6004da7628a05ab64c654b2637e23401e.jpg)  
Some default and optional chart elements  

The available chart elements include the following:  

 Axes These elements control the display of the category and value axis labels, not the display of the data.   
 Axis titles These identify the categories, values, or series along each axis. Chart title The name by which you identify the chart. The chart title can appear above the chart or overlaid across the center of the chart. Data labels These identify the exact values represented by the data markers on the chart. They can be displayed inside or outside of the data markers. Data table This table provides details of the plotted data points in table format, essentially mimicking the worksheet. A data table can incorporate a legend. Error bars These indicators mark a fixed amount or percentage of deviation from the plotted value for one or more series. Gridlines Major and minor horizontal and vertical gridlines identify measurement points along each axis and help to visually quantify the data points. Legend This listing correlates the data marker color and name of each data series. The legend can be displayed on any side of the plot area. Lines On charts that plot data that doesn’t touch the category axis (such as an area chart or line chart), these lines drop from the plotted points to the corresponding value on the category axis.   
 Trendline This line marks a value that is calculated on all the series values in a category. It most commonly marks the average of the values but can also be based on other equations. Up/down bars These bars indicate the difference between the high and low values for a category of data in a series.  

All the chart elements are optional, and some chart types don’t support all the elements. For example, a pie chart doesn’t display axes or gridlines because they wouldn’t be a logical part of that type of data display.  

Each chart type has a set of Quick Layouts that you can use to display or position specific sets of chart elements.  

![](images/63273e90c6addfd3ca967b9a718633963ed24d4ea127931db6a0a37775e7b792.jpg)  
Apply a Quick Layout to quickly change multiple chart elements  

The Quick Layouts are preset combinations of the available chart elements. When the preset layouts don’t produce the chart you want, you can create a custom layout by mixing and matching different chart elements. You can control the display of chart elements from the Add Chart Element menu on the Design tool tab, and from the Chart Elements pane that opens when you select the button to the right of the chart.  

![](images/f4f8f770eee1122f85a129775401791bfd997fd53dcda6d553842583c5dc4dfa.jpg)  
The menu and pane include only chart elements that apply to the current chart type  

You can apply the same chart elements from both locations. The Add Chart Element menu provides a bit more visual guidance than the Chart Elements pane but is farther from the chart.  

You can adjust a chart layout by adding, deleting, moving, and sizing chart elements. To perform any of those tasks, you must first select the element. The following table describes some of the options available for common chart elements.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Chart element</td><td>Options</td></tr><tr><td>Axes</td><td>Primary Horizontal, Primary Vertical, or both</td></tr><tr><td>Axis Titles</td><td>Primary Horizontal, Primary Vertical, or both</td></tr><tr><td>Chart Title</td><td>Above Chart or Centered Overlay</td></tr><tr><td>Data Labels</td><td>Center, Inside End, Inside Base, Outside End, or Data Callout</td></tr><tr><td>Data Table</td><td>With Legend Keys or No Legend Keys</td></tr><tr><td>Error Bars</td><td>Standard Error, Percentage, or Standard Deviation</td></tr><tr><td>Gridlines</td><td>Primary Major Horizontal, Primary Major Vertical, Primary Minor Horizontal, Primary Minor Vertical, or any combination of the four options</td></tr><tr><td>Legend</td><td>Right, Top, Left, or Bottom</td></tr><tr><td>Lines</td><td>Drop Lines or High-Low Lines</td></tr><tr><td>Trendline</td><td>Linear, Exponential, Linear Forecast, or Moving Average</td></tr><tr><td>Up/Down Bars</td><td>(on or off)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# Tip  

You can use standard techniques to add pictures, shapes, and independent text boxes to pages to enhance charts.  

To apply a preset layout to a chart  

Select the chart. On the Design tool tab, in the Chart Layouts gallery, select the Quick Layout button, and then select the layout you want.  

To display the Add Chart Element menu  

Select the chart. On the Design tool tab, in the Chart Layouts group, select the Add Chart Element button.  

To display the Chart Elements pane  

Select the chart, and then select the Chart Elements button that appears to the right of the chart.  

To specify which chart elements to display on the chart  

1. Select the chart, and then open the Add Chart Element menu. 2. On the Add Chart Element menu, select the chart element, and then select one or more options to select or clear them.  


# Pie charts  

Unlike column, bar, and line charts, which plot at least two series of data points, pie charts plot only one series, with each data point, or slice, reflecting a fraction of the whole series. If you plot a multi-series chart and then change the chart type to a pie chart, Word hides all but the first series, retaining the hidden information in case you change back to a chart type capable of showing more than one series. You can switch to a different series by selecting the Chart Filters button to the right of the chart, selecting the series you want in the Series area of the Chart Filters pane, and selecting Apply.  

When you plot a pie chart, you can use an effective formatting option that is not available with multi-series chart types. To draw attention to individual data points, you can “explode” the pie by dragging individual slices away from the center. Or you can double-click a slice to select it and open the Format Data Point pane, where you can set a precise Angle Of First Slice and Point Explosion percentage.  

# To change the size of a selected chart or chart element  

Point to any sizing handle (the hollow dots around the chart frame), and when the pointer changes to a double-headed arrow, drag in the direction you want the chart to grow or shrink.  

# Tip  

If an element cannot be resized, it doesn’t have sizing handles when selected.  

To change the position of a selected chart element  

Point to the border around the element, away from any handles, and when the four-headed arrow appears, drag the chart to the new location.  

# Tip  

Some elements cannot be moved, even if the four-headed arrow appears.  

To rotate a three-dimensional chart layout  

1. Right-click the chart, and then select 3-D Rotation.  

2. In the 3-D Rotation area of the Effects page of the Format Chart Area pane, set the angle of rotation for each axis.  

# FORMAT CHARTS  

You can quickly format a chart and its individual parts by applying fills, outlines, and effects to the following components:  

Chart area You can specify the background fill, the border color and style, effects such as shadows and edges, the three-dimensional format and rotation, and the size and position. You can also attach text to be displayed when someone points to the chart.   
Plot area You can specify the background fill, the border color and style, effects such as shadows and edges, and the three-dimensional format and rotation. Data markers You can specify the background fill, the border color and style, effects such as shadows and edges, and the three-dimensional format. You can also precisely determine the gap between data points.   
Legend You can specify the background fill, the border color and style, and effects such as shadows and edges. You can also specify the legend’s position and whether it can overlap the chart.   
Axes You can specify the background fill, the line color and style, effects such as shadows and edges, and the three-dimensional format and rotation. For the category axis, you can also specify the scale, add or remove tick marks, adjust the label position, and determine the starting and maximum values. You can set the number format (such as currency or percentage), and set the axis label alignment. Gridlines You can set the line color, line style, and effects such as shadows and edges.   
Data table You can specify the background fill, the border color and style, effects such as shadows and edges, and the three-dimensional format. You can also set table borders.   
Titles You can specify the background fill, the border color and style, effects such as shadows and edges, and the three-dimensional format. You can also set the title’s alignment, direction, and angle of rotation.  

If you don’t want to spend a lot of time formatting individual chart elements, you can apply a predefined chart style to create a sophisticated appearance with a minimum of effort. Chart styles affect only the formatting of the chart components and elements; they don’t change the presence of the chart elements.  

The Chart Styles pane has two pages: Style and Color. From the Style page, you can preview and apply the chart styles. From the Color page, you can change the colors that are used in the chart without affecting other document elements.  

![](images/d501ed1d11c77f1b97d8ae73f6864383afd746699637cf68edbec42928101bd8.jpg)  

# Change the chart colors without changing the template  

You can apply these same styles and colors from the Chart Styles group on the Design tool tab. From the Format tool tab, you can apply shape styles and WordArt styles to chart elements.  

You can fine-tune the formatting of a selected chart element in its Format pane. Each type of element has a specific Format pane. Most Format panes have settings that are divided into multiple pages, such as Fill & Line, Effects, Size & Position, and an Options page that is specific to the selected chart element. You can display different options by selecting the elements in the pane header.  

![](images/d9e201c2a0f4ed2ba790a55bbf11bfeb1dac2da78e4fea7aca87c3d213a908ea.jpg)  

Commands for formatting different elements are on separate pages of the pane  

To apply a chart style to a chart  

Select the chart, and then do either of the following:  On the Design tool tab, in the Chart Styles gallery, select the style you want. Select the Chart Styles button, and then on the Style page of the Chart Stylespane, select the style you want.  

To change the colors of chart elements without changing the theme colors  

Select the chart, and then do either of the following:  

 On the Design tool tab, in the Chart Styles gallery, select Change Colors, and then select the color set you want. To the right of the chart, select the Chart Styles button, and then on the Color page of the Chart Styles pane, select the style you want.  

To select a chart component for formatting  On the chart, click the element once. If the element is difficult to identify or select, on the Format tool tab, in the Current Selection group, display the Chart Elements list, and then select the component you want.  

# Tip  

If you want to activate the chart (that is, select the chart area), be sure to click a blank area inside the chart frame. Clicking any of the chart’s elements will activate that element, not the chart as a whole.  

To apply a preset style to a selected chart component  On the Format tool tab, in the Shape Styles gallery, select the style you want.  

To apply a fill color, outline color, or effect to a selected chart component  

On the Format tool tab, in the Shape Styles group, select the Shape Fill, Shape Outline, or Shape Effects button, and then select the option you want.  

To apply a WordArt style to the text in a selected chart  

On the Format tool tab, in the WordArt Styles group, expand the Quick Stylesgallery if necessary and then select the style you want.  

To apply WordArt style components to a selected chart component In the WordArt Styles group, select the Text Fill, Text Outline, or Text Effectsbutton, and then select the option you want.  

To open the Format pane for a chart element  

 Do any of the following:   
 Double-click the chart element. Right-click the element, and then select Format Element. At the top of an open Format pane, select the downward-pointing triangle to the right of the Options label, and then select an element to open that Format pane. If you have trouble double-clicking a smaller chart element, on the Format tool tab, in the Current Selection group, display the Chart Elements list, and then select the element you want.  

# Tip  

To open the Format Major Gridlines pane, right-click any gridline, and then select Format Gridlines. To open the Format Data Table pane, right-click the selected data table, and then select Format Data Table.  

# KEY POINTS  

 A chart is often the most efficient way to present numeric data with at-a-glance clarity. You can select the type of chart and change the appearance of its elements until it clearly conveys key information. Existing data in a Word table, Excel workbook, Access database, or other structured source can easily be copied and pasted into the associated chart worksheet, eliminating time-consuming typing.

# Create charts  

Open the CreateCharts document, and then perform the following tasks:  

1. Position the cursor in the blank paragraph below the Regional Averages heading.   
2. Insert a chart, using the 3-D Clustered Column chart type (the fourth chart from the left in the Column category).   
3. In the linked chart data worksheet, select and delete all the sample data, leaving only the colors that identify the series, categories, and values.   
4. In cell B1, enter March. Then press the Tab key to enter the heading on the chart and move to the next cell of the worksheet.  

# Tip  

To move within the plotted data, press Tab to move to the right in the same row, Shift $\cdot+$ Tab to move to the left, Enter to move down in the column (or to the beginning of a data entry series), or Shift $^{;+}$ Enter to move up.  

5. In cells C1 through E1, enter June, September, and December.  

# Tip  

If you were entering a sequential list of months, you could enter January and then drag the fill handle in the lower-right corner of the cell to the right to fill subsequent cells in the same row with the names of the months.   
When you enter December, notice that it is outside of the table data area and does not appear on the chart in the document. You will fix this in the next practice task.   
6. In cells A2 through A4, enter Minimum, Average, and Maximum, pressing the Enter key between entries.   
7. In cell B2, enter 37, and press Tab. Notice that a corresponding column appears in the chart.   
8. In cells C2 through E2, enter 54, 53, and 29, pressing Tab to move from cell to cell. After you enter the last number, press Enter to move to cell B3.   
9. Enter the following data into the chart worksheet, noticing as you enter data that the chart columns and scale change to reflect the data.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>E</td></tr><tr><td>3 47</td><td>67</td><td>66</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>4 56</td><td>80</td><td>70</td><td>41</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# 10. Close the Chart in Microsoft Word window.  

Notice that the temperatures on the chart are grouped by category rather than by month, and the December temperatures are missing. You will fix these issues in the next practice task.  

11. Open the Temperatures workbook from the practice file folder in Excel. Select the chart on the worksheet and copy it to the Clipboard.  

12. Return to the CreateCharts document. Position the cursor in the blank paragraph after the Local Averages heading, and then paste the chart from the Clipboard into the document. Notice that the chart takes on the color scheme of the document.  

13. The chart type used for this data, Stacked Column, sums the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for each month.  

14. Change the chart type of the Local Averages chart to Line with Markers (the fourth chart from the left in the Line category) to display the three temperature series individually.  

15. Save and close the document. Then close the workbook.  

# Modify charts  

Open the ModifyCharts document, and then perform the following tasks:  

1. Select the chart and open the linked chart data worksheet in Word.   
2. In the worksheet, drag the blue handle so that the colored cells include only those that contain content (A1:E4). Notice that the December data appears in the chart.   
3. In the document, select the chart. Then switch the data across the category and series axes to display the temperatures in groups by month.   
4. In the worksheet, change the text in cells B1:E1 to Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. Then close the linked chart data worksheet.  

5. Open the Chart Filters pane, and then do the following:  

1. Point to each item in the Series and Category areas of the pane to highlight those values on the chart.  

2. Clear all the check boxes in the Series area, and then select only the Average check box.  

3. Select Apply to modify the chart.  

6. Repeat step 5 to display only the Minimum and Maximum series values.  

7. From the Quick Layout gallery on the Design tool tab, apply Layout 9 to the chart. Notice that this adds a chart title, axis titles, and a legend to the chart area.  

8. Add the following elements to the chart:  

0. Primary Minor Horizontal gridlines  

1. Data labels  

# Tip  

You can add data labels to the chart only from the Chart Elements pane, not from the Add Chart Elements menu.  

9. Remove the horizontal Axis Title placeholder from the chart.  

10. Replace the vertical Axis Title placeholder with Degrees Fahrenheit.  

11. Replace the Chart Title placeholder with Regional Averages.  

12. Select the legend. Drag its top border to align with the top horizontal gridline, and its bottom border to align with the bottom horizontal gridline. Notice that the legend entries move to fill the space.   
13. Drag the chart title to the right so that it right-aligns with the legend. Then click outside the chart to view the results.   
14. Experiment with any other chart modification procedures that interest you. Then save and close the document.  

# Format charts

5. Select the vertical axis title and change the font size to 12 points.   
6. Select the plot area (not the chart area) and double-click it to open its Format pane. In the Format Plot Area pane, explore the various options that are available for formatting this component.   
7. At the top of the pane, select the downward-pointing arrow next to Plot Area Options, and select another chart component or element to display its Format pane.   
8. Experiment with any other chart formatting procedures that interest you. Then save and close the document.  

# FORMAT THE PAGE BACKGROUND  

Whether you’re creating a document that will be printed, viewed on a computer, or published on the internet and viewed in a web browser, you can make the document pages stand out by changing the page background. You can configure a solid color background or apply any of the following effects:  

Gradient You can select a premade gradient or choose two colors and the direction you want the gradient to flow—for example, horizontal, diagonal down, or from the center—to have Word blend them for you.  

![](images/622ee5c95e7f264b5f00350599ee1c0c583b45701d6fc81fd24f4df87a2a999d.jpg)  
You can configure fill effects with multiple colors and in a variety of directions  

Texture Word offers 24 predefined textures, including textures designed to resemble papyrus, denim, woven mat, water droplets, granite, cork, and wood. In addition to these, you can apply textures saved as image files on your own computer, and even locate additional textures online.  

![](images/728ec01b59cd893958bf1abe0e65f0bd861f1cdb1d85f1cf0ccec15de7cf871f.jpg)  
A page with the Water Droplets texture applied to the background  

Pattern Word offers a variety of predefined patterns, such as polka dots, stripes, and checkerboards—and even plaid. In addition to choosing a pattern, you select a foreground and background color.  

![](images/792df3253f1ee75a57eeff965f1f473853477b499f41c3e77232b2e9e6ebda82.jpg)  

Word provides a preview of the selected effect in the Sample box  

# Tip  

When you use a texture or pattern background, Word configures it to repeat seamlessly across the page.  

Picture You can use a picture from your computer or any connected online storage locations as the document background.  

![](images/56d68488c93f3da615943fbf86210a5f8307ecca6c49f5c30649f0bdd0e1e328.jpg)  

Use any photo as the page background  

You can insert a background picture from the Texture tab or Picture tab of the Fill Effects dialog box, though with slightly different results. Inserting an image from the Texture tab adds it to the Texture gallery.  

Another way to change the background of your document is to apply a border. This is a good way to provide some definition to your document. Word offers several border styles from which to choose, including Box, Shadow, 3-D, and more. You can also change the style, color, and thickness of the border. For a bit more pizzazz, you can apply an Art border. Options include borders made of stars, suns, flowers, and more.  

#

# A blank page with an art border applied  

When it comes to backgrounds, the trick is to not overdo it. The effects should be subtle enough that they do not interfere with the text or other elements on the page or make the document difficult to read.  

# Tip  

To make it easier to see the effect of your background changes on your document, display the whole page in the app window by selecting the One Page button in the Zoom group on the View tab.

# Text watermarks can be any color  

Word offers various predefined text watermarks, including CONFIDENTIAL, DO NOT COPY, and URGENT watermarks. These watermarks can be positioned diagonally or horizontally on the page. Additional predefined text watermarks are available from Office.com.  

In addition, you can create a custom text watermark that features whatever text you like. For example, you might create a text watermark that includes the name of your organization. When you create a custom text watermark, you can select the font, size, and color of the text, whether it appears diagonally or horizontally, and whether it is solid or semitransparent.  

If you want to dress up the pages of your document without taking attention from the main text, you might consider displaying a graphic watermark, such as a company logo or an image that subtly reinforces your message. Watermarks are visible in printed and online documents, but because they are faint, they don’t interfere with the display of the document’s main text.

You can use a picture, such as a company or team logo, as a watermark  

By default, the Watermark feature adds a watermark to all pages of your document except the title page (if the document includes a title page). If you want to add the watermark to only specific pages, you can do so by adding it in the header or footer defined for those pages.  

# To add a predefined watermark to a document  

1. Open the document to which you want to add a watermark. 2. On the Design tab, in the Page Background group, select the Watermark button to display the Watermark gallery and menu.  

![](images/38f081d8b948e71fcd27f174eb1aa0fd61c382751eb26fe659c9ce8814bde2cf.jpg)  
The predefined categories include Confidential, Disclaimer, and Urgent  

3. In the gallery, select a watermark to insert it in light gray on every page of the document.  


# Tip  

If you’re not sure what scale to choose, select Auto. Word will scale the picture automatically.  

5. If you want the picture to appear washed out, select the Washout check box.  

6. Do either of the following:  

0. Select Apply to apply the watermark to the document but leave the dialog box open, so that you can review the effect and make adjustments if you want. 1. Select OK to apply the watermark and close the dialog box.  

To add a watermark to every other page of a document  

1. Open the document header or footer.   
2. On the Header & Footer Tools Design tool tab, in the Options group, select the Different Odd & Even Pages check box.   
3. Move to any odd or even page header or footer.   
4. Follow the procedure to insert a predefined, custom text, or picture watermark.   
5. On the Design tool tab, in the Close group, select Close Header & Footer.  


# INSERT HEADERS, FOOTERS, AND PAGE NUMBERS  

You can display information on every page of a document in regions at the top and bottom of a page by selecting a style from the Header or Footer gallery. Word displays dotted borders to indicate the header and footer areas, and displays a Design tool tab on the ribbon. You can enter and format information in the header and footer by  

using the same techniques you do in the document body and also by using commands on the Design tool tab.  

Headers and footers are highly customizable. You can have a different header and footer on the first page of a document and different headers and footers on odd and even pages. You can manually insert text or graphic elements in a header or footer, select common elements (such as page number, date and time, or a document property) from a menu, or insert a preformatted building block. (For more information about building blocks, see the next topic, “Insert preformatted document parts.”) You can also mix different headers, footers, and document themes to create a document that has the look and feel you want.  

![](images/65a25eafc41fb95fc8540b5c2c2f4b56261fae360278fdd130bb72f770071822.jpg)  
Headers and footers can include any information you want to display  

If your document contains section breaks, each successive section inherits the headers and footers of the preceding section unless you break the link between the two sections. You can then create a different header and footer for the current section. For information about sections, see “Control what appears on each page” in Chapter 12, “Finalize and distribute documents.”  

It is common to insert page numbers in a document that will be printed. You can manually insert a page number element in a header or footer, or use one of the many predefined header, footer, or page number objects Word provides on the Design tool tab for headers and footers. These predefined page number options insert the number in the header, footer, left margin, or right margin. They may also include the word “Page,” document properties such as the title or total number of pages, and themed graphic elements.  

# To insert custom header or footer content  

1. Activate the header or footer by using one of these methods:  

1. Position the cursor anywhere in the document. On the Insert tab, in the Header & Footer group, select the Header button or the Footer button, and then select the corresponding Edit command on the menu.  

2. In Print Layout view, double-click in the top margin of a page to activate the header or in the bottom margin to activate the footer.  

2. In the header or footer area, do any of the following:   
0. Insert and format content by using the standard commands.   
1. From the Insert group on the Design tool tab, insert the date, time, an image, or document information you want to include.   
2. Use the preset tabs to align content at the left margin, in the center, and at the right margin, or modify the tabs to meet your needs.   
3. In the Close group, select the Close Header and Footer button.  


# To delete a header or footer  

Activate the header or footer. Press $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{A}$ to select all the content of the header or footer, and then press the Delete key.   
On the Insert tab, in the Header & Footer group,   
select Header or Footer, and then select the   
corresponding Remove command.  

# INSERT PREFORMATTED DOCUMENT PARTS  

To simplify the creation of professional-looking text elements, Word 2019 comes with ready-made visual representations of text, known as building blocks, which are available from various groups on the Insert tab. Headers and footers, which were covered in the previous topic, are one type of building block.  

In addition to inserting headers and footers, you can insert the following types of building blocks:  

Cover page You can quickly add a formatted cover page to a document such as a report by selecting a style from the Cover Page gallery. The cover page includes text placeholders for elements such as a title so that you can customize the page to reflect the content of the document.  

![](images/ac5af683a1e5f3fe80c01652a87a98e42259da16d69b3ebb7efc158dfbf61a48.jpg)  

You can add document-specific information to the basic cover page  

Text box To reinforce key concepts and also alleviate the monotony of page after page of plain text, you can insert text boxes such as sidebars and quote boxes by selecting a style from the Text Box gallery. The formatted text box includes placeholder text that you replace with your own.

Placeholder text in the quote box tells how to enter text and move the quote box on the page  

Most building blocks include text fields that contain placeholders for information. For example, a cover page building block might contain placeholders for the date, title, subtitle, author name, company name, or company address. You can replace this text by selecting it and then typing over it with text of your own. For example, you can select the Document Title placeholder text in a cover page and replace it with the actual title of your document.  

# Tip  

If any of the required information—such as Author—is already saved with the properties of the document into which you’re inserting the cover page, Word inserts the saved information instead of the placeholders. For information about document properties, see “Prepare documents for electronic distribution” in Chapter 12, “Finalize and distribute documents.”  

Of course, you are not restricted to the default contents of the building block. You can change the building block in any way that you want to—altering the text and various visual elements. For example, if you insert a text box building block, you can change the box’s size and other characteristics by using the Format tool tab that appears when the box is selected. Think of the building box as a convenient starting point.  

You can display all available building blocks in the Building Blocks Organizer dialog box. The left pane of this dialog box displays a complete list of all the building blocks available on your computer. Selecting a building block in the left pane displays a preview in the right pane, along with its description and behavior.  

![](images/cab7233d1e1d24c9343e300a7601b2889728a4a73bbe41bab85c7d9f2118b6f0.jpg)  
The Building Blocks Organizer includes all available building blocks  

Initially, the building blocks are organized by type, as reflected in the Gallery column. If you want to insert building blocks of the same design in a document—for example, a cover page, footer, header, quote box, and sidebar all in the Whisp design—you might want to select the Name column heading to sort the list alphabetically by design name. Some elements, such as bibliographies, equations, tables of contents, tables, and watermarks, are not part of a design family and have their own unique names.  

You can display a dialog box containing all the information about a selected building block in a more readable format. To do so, select the building block you want to learn more about, and then select the Edit Properties button in the lower-left corner of the Building Blocks Organizer dialog box. Although you can use this dialog box to change the properties associated with any building block, be cautious when doing so. If you change the properties assigned to a building block that came with Word, you might accidentally render it unusable.

# The Modify Building Block dialog box  

If you frequently use a specific element in your documents, such as a formatted titlesubtitle-author arrangement at the beginning of reports, you can define it as a custom building block. It will then then become available from the Quick Parts gallery.  


# Tip  

If you begin entering your name in a name placeholder, Word should recognize it from the user name information stored with the app and display a ScreenTip containing your completed name. Press Enter when the ScreenTip appears to have Word insert your name for you.  

# To insert a text box building block  

1. On the Insert tab, in the Text group, select the Text Box button to display the available text box building blocks.  

![](images/3fafa4df6c8eb82fff691859b70998c5e4c9d32e3b4974b89d2170726044bfc9.jpg)  
Predefined text boxes share graphic elements with themes  

2. Scroll through the gallery to review the available text boxes, and then select the one you want to insert.  

Insert and link custom text boxes  

If you prefer to start from scratch rather than using one of the preformatted text box building blocks, you can draw and format your own text box. Here’s how:  

1. On the Insert tab, select Text Box, and then select Draw Text Box.   
2. Drag to draw a box of the approximate size you want anywhere on the page.   
3. Enter the text and format it the way you would any other text.   
4 Optionally, select the text box frame and format the text box shape, outline, fill, and   
other properties by using the commands on the Format tool tab.  

When a text box has a solid border, you can reposition it by dragging it to another location or by pressing the arrow keys. You can rotate it by dragging the rotate handle and change its size by dragging the size handles around its frame.  

You can link text boxes so that text flows from one to the next. To do so:  

1. Ensure that the second text box is empty.   
2. Select the first text box.   
3. On the Format tool tab, in the Text group, select Create Link. The pointer shape changes to a pitcher.  

4. Point to the second text box. When the pointer changes to a pouring pitcher, click once.  

Text boxes are not accessible to adaptive technologies, so if you want to ensure that a textreading program can access the content of your document, do not use a text box.  

# KEY POINTS  

A background color, texture, pattern, or picture can really give a document pizzazz, but be careful that it doesn’t overwhelm the text. By using a watermark, you can flag every page of a document with a faint word, such as “Confidential,” or a faint picture. Watermarks appear behind the text of the document, so the text can still be read.   
Word comes with predefined building blocks that you can use to quickly add graphic elements to a document.  

![](images/3364857777ad2dfcd9263f71f9eef47af549fbb49f05628512bde6d2b7aa47f2.jpg)

5. Click in the Company Address placeholder and enter 1234 Main Street, New York, NY, 90012.   
6. On page 2 of the document, to the left of the Warehouse heading, insert a Banded Quote text box.   
7. Click in the placeholder text and type Consolidated Messenger believes in opportunity for all! We are an equal-opportunity employer. Then click anywhere outside the text box building block.   
8. Save and close the document.  

# REORGANIZE DOCUMENT OUTLINES  

When you create a document, you can divide the document into logical sections by using headings. Heading styles define not only formatting but also outline levels. These outline levels are visible in the Navigation pane and also in Outline view.  

![](images/1c754981259d047d9d606e0f0bee8dcb9d8b945580989dffb6fcfe9a1986bae6.jpg)  


# Manage content in the Navigation pane  

When working in Print Layout view, you can display a hierarchical structure of the document headings in the Navigation pane. By default, the Navigation pane displays document content styled as Heading 1, Heading 2, or Heading 3. You can display up to nine heading levels in the Navigation pane. (The display is controlled by the outline level rather than by the heading name.) If you use custom styles, you can set the outline levels of the styles to control the Navigation pane content.  

You can reorganize document content by dragging headings in the Navigation pane. You can also promote, demote, or remove sections by using commands on the Navigation pane shortcut menu.  

![](images/449d15480c82bc9d71139f75513b1fd7ed06caa14a3765162c4c2531b3f755ed.jpg)  

You can work with a document in the Navigation pane in much the same way you can in Outline view  

To display the Navigation pane  

 On the View tab, in the Show group, select the Navigation Pane check box.  

To change the outline levels displayed in the Navigation pane  

Right-click anywhere in the Navigation pane, select Show Heading Levels, and then select the lowest outline level that you want to display.  

To move a document section in the Navigation pane In the Navigation pane, drag the heading of the section you want to move to the new location. (A bold horizontal line indicates the drop location.)  

# Manage content in Outline view  

When you format headings by using Word’s built-in heading styles, it’s easy to view and organize the document in Outline view. In this view, you can hide all the body text and display only the headings at and above a particular level. You can also rearrange the sections of a document by moving their headings. When you display a document in Outline view, Word displays the document with a hierarchical structure, and the Outlining tab appears on the ribbon between the File and Home tabs.  

![](images/35442330651d621dda114a8eb624564ef146ec6eb8d79a64ff723cf2f6f3b649.jpg)  

The indentations and symbols used in Outline view to indicate the level of a heading or paragraph in the document’s structure don’t appear in the document in other views or when you print it.  

To easily reference paragraph styles while working in Outline view, you can display the style area pane to the left of the document. For information about displaying and resizing the style area pane, see “Display different views of documents” in Chapter 2,  

![](images/246916fc0c0f9cd1dfb3ac090dc5c8359832cee19805c7551c4e7320cea071e7.jpg)  

# Double dotted lines indicate collapsed content  

You can use commands in the Outline Tools group of the Outlining tab to do the following:  

Display only the headings at a specific level and above. Word displays a double dotted line under the heading if the document contains text below it. Collapse or expand a specific heading.   
Expand the entire outline to display the document in its entirety.   
Promote or demote headings or body text by changing their level.  

Move headings and their text up or down in the document.  

# Tip  

You can select the buttons in the Master Document group to create a master document with subdocuments that you can then display or hide. The topic of master documents and subdocuments is beyond the scope of this book. For information, use the Tell Me What You Want To Do text box.  

To display a document in Outline view  

On the View tab, in the Views group, select Outline.  

To change the outline levels displayed in Outline view  

On the Outlining tab, in the Outline Tools group, in the Outline Level list, select Level $\pmb{n}$ , where $n$ is the lowest level of heading you want to display.   
 Press Alt $^{\cdot+}$ Shift $+{\pmb n}$ , where $n$ is the lowest level of heading you want to display  

To collapse or expand a single document section in Outline view  

Position the cursor in the heading of the section you want to collapse or expand. Then do either of the following: On the Outlining tab, in the Outline Tools group, select the Collapse or Expandbutton.   
Press Alt $^{\cdot+}$ Shift $^{\cdot+}$ Minus Sign to collapse the section or Alt $^{\cdot+}$ Shift $^{\cdot+}$ Plus Sign to expand the section.  

To expand the entire document in Outline view  

 On the Outlining tab, in the Outline Tools group, in the Show Levels list, select All Levels.   
 Press Alt $^+$ Shift $\mathbf{+A}$ .  

To promote or demote a heading in Outline view  

Position the cursor in the heading you want to promote or demote. Then do either of the following:   
In the Outline Tools group, select the Promote or Demote button.   
Press Alt $^+$ Shift $^+$ Left Arrow to promote the heading or Alt $^{+}$ Shift $^+$ Right Arrowto demote the heading.  

# Tip  

Promoting or demoting a heading also promotes or demotes subheadings within that section to maintain the content hierarchy.  

To move a document section in Outline view  

Select the plus sign to the left of the heading to select the section. Then do either of the following: In the Outline Tools group, select the Move Up button or Move Down button as many times as necessary to move the section to the target location.  

 Press Alt $^+$ Shift ${\bf\nabla}+{\bf U}{\bf p}$ Arrow or Alt $^{+}$ Shift $^{\cdot+}$ Down Arrow as many times as necessary to move the section to the target location.  

# To close Outline view  

On the Outlining tab, in the Close group, select Close Outline View to display the document in Print Layout view.  

# ARRANGE OBJECTS ON A PAGE  

In previous chapters, you learned basic ways to position an object, such as a picture or shape, on a page. When you position an object on a page, text wraps around that object by default. You are not limited to the basic settings you’ve explored thus far, however. In fact, you can position objects and change text-wrap settings in several ways.  

The Position gallery of layout options is available for most objects from the contextual Format tool tab. These options position the object in a specific location relative to the page margins.  

![](images/982a102a13326ff58df1cd3047063d72462bacad89e5bef59c8e8f4c7cc773e3.jpg)  
The Position gallery offers several preconfigured position options  

The Layout Options menu, which appears when you insert or select an object, provides text-wrapping options.  

![](images/023bd7537d0b0b9bfa9c015f449758ce797f3f7c32be1b2216bddad3a233d2a1.jpg)  

From the Layout Options menu, you can quickly set a text-wrapping option  

The standard text-wrapping options include the following:  

In Line with Text As its name suggests, when you choose this option, the object is placed in line with the text. The text does not wrap around the object Square When you choose Square, text wraps around the object in a square shape. Tight Choose this option if you want text to wrap more tightly around the object. Through The effects of this setting are most obvious when you insert an irregularly shaped object. When this option is selected, text appears to go through the object, filling in any blank spaces within it. Top and Bottom This option places the object on its own line, with no text on either side of it. Behind Text When you choose this option, the object is placed behind, or underneath, any existing text.  In Front of Text This setting lays the object on top of existing text, thereby obscuring it.  

You can display the Layout dialog box from either the Position menu or the Layout Options menu. The Text Wrapping tab of the Layout dialog box offers the same textwrapping styles as the Layout Options menu. In addition, you can fine-tune textwrapping settings—for example, indicating whether text should wrap on both sides of the object and how far the object should be from the text.  

![](images/ab6d26bc21209bf68291736b3b8d7a10216bad746c2e75620c6327eb7ac1a366.jpg)  
For more exact text wrapping, configure the settings on the Text Wrapping tab  

For more position settings, including settings you can use to specify whether the position is absolute or relative (more on that in a moment), you can use the commands on the Position tab of the Layout dialog box. The available positions vary based on the selected text-wrapping option.  

![](images/ee2c1a4741bcd928a343499da49eb5fe43a45293fe3951b71db0cabf5ad3ceb1.jpg)  

You can fine-tune position settings on the Position tab  

When you choose a text-wrapping option other than In Line With Text, you can specify that an object be positioned in a specific location on the page or relative to a page element, or you can anchor it to a paragraph so it moves with the content.  

You can also use alignment commands to align objects with the margins and with each other. You can access these commands from the Align menu on the Format tool tab.  

![](images/f6270bae848d5749ed793262bcac15ff37dc8d47f268c74831372043a5f926cc.jpg)  

The picture is aligned with the top and left page margins  

You can move an object manually by dragging it to another position on the page. To make it easier to align objects, you can display a grid that divides the page content area into squares of specific dimensions.  

![](images/66f33dc160e376df8fa2f682309e5a52a5b99cc3569e22ff1a71a47670624602.jpg)  

# You can display a grid to help with aligning objects  

You can change the grid settings in the Grid And Guides dialog box. You can choose whether to display alignment guides, such as margins, and whether items should be snapped, or automatically aligned, to the grid or to other objects. You can also change the size of the grid.  

If you insert several objects and then position them so that they overlap, they are said to be stacked. The stacking order (which object appears on top of which) is initially determined by the order in which you inserted the objects, but it can also be determined by other factors, such as the type of text wrapping assigned to each object. If all the objects have the same kind of text wrapping, you can change their order. You do so by using buttons in the Arrange group on the Format tool tab, or from the Selection pane, which displays a list of all the objects on the page.  

![](images/3f73735170e2964a03274c9a0bd08cf0c41b3b755a4c703f9fd79e348c2f0dff.jpg)  

# To display the Selection pane  

On the Home tab, in the Editing group, click Select, and then in the list, select Selection Pane. Select the object. Then on the Format tool tab, in the Arrange group, select the Selection Pane button.  

To select an object  

On the page, select the object.   
In the Selection pane, select the object’s name.  

To position an object on a page  

1. Select the object.   
2. On the Format tool tab, in the Arrange group, select the Position button to display the Position gallery and menu.   
3. In the Position gallery, point to a thumbnail to display a live preview of that option’s effect on the position of the object. When you find the position you like, select the corresponding thumbnail.  



# Tip  

When objects have a text-wrapping setting other than In Line With Text, you can use the options on the Align menu to align multiple objects horizontally or vertically. You can also distribute selected objects equally between the first and last objects in the selection.  

To display or hide gridlines in the content area  

On the Format tool tab, in the Arrange group, select the Align button, and then select View Gridlines.  

To change grid settings  

1. On the Format tool tab, in the Arrange group, select the Align button, and then select Grid Settings to open the Grid And Guides dialog box.  

![](images/5d062b3823e56fe53e4179fec5d2297ca4e947bf9345ca912a1032fae5ee32d2.jpg)  

You can specify the location and functionality of the on-screen alignment guides and grid  

2. Make any changes you want, and then select OK.  

To manually move an object  

1. Select the object.   
2. Drag the selected object to the target location.  

# Tip  

If the grid is displayed and has been configured to allow snapping, the object will snap to the nearest gridline when it is dropped. To move an object without snapping it to the grid, hold down the Ctrl key while pressing an arrow key. The object will move in tiny increments.  

To change the stacking order of objects  

1. Select the object that you want to move. 2. On the Format tool tab, in the Arrange group, do one of the following: 1. Select the Bring Forward button to move the selected object one position closer to the top of the stack. 2. In the Bring Forward list, select Bring to Front to move the object to the top of the stack.  

3. Select the Send Backward button to move the selected object one position closer to the bottom of the stack.  

4. In the Send Backward list, select Send to Back to move the object to the bottom of the stack.  

To hide objects on the page  

1. Open the Selection pane. The eye icon to the right of each object indicates that it is currently visible on the page.   
2. In the Selection pane, do either of the following:   
1. To hide one object, select the eye icon to the right of the object name.   
2. To hide all the objects in the document, select the Hide All button. The eye icon changes to a small horizontal bar, indicating that an object is hidden.  

# To display hidden objects  

In the Selection pane, do either of the following:  To display one object, select the bar icon to the right of the object’s name.  To display all the objects in the document, select the Show All button.  

# USE TABLES TO CONTROL PAGE LAYOUT  

Most people are accustomed to thinking of a table as a means of displaying data in a quick, easy-to-grasp format. But tables can also serve to organize content in creative ways. For example, suppose you want to display two tables next to each other. The simplest way to do this is to first create a page-width table that has only one row and two columns, and then insert one of the tables you want to display in the first cell and the other table in the second cell. When the outer table borders are hidden, these nested tables appear side by side.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Consultation Fee</td><td colspan="2">Trip Charges</td></tr><tr><td>Location</td><td>HourlyRate</td><td>Distance</td><td>Fee</td></tr><tr><td>Inhome</td><td>$50.00</td><td>0-10miles</td><td>No charge</td></tr><tr><td>Phone</td><td>$35.00</td><td>11-20miles</td><td>$10.00</td></tr><tr><td>Instore</td><td>$40.00</td><td>Over20miles</td><td>$20.00</td></tr></table></body></html>  

These tables are nested within the cells of a one-row, two-column table  

As with regular tables, you can create a nested table in one of three ways:  

From scratch By formatting existing information By inserting Microsoft Excel data  

And just like with other tables, you can format a nested table either manually or by using one of the ready-made table styles.  

You can use tables to organize a mixture of elements such as text, tables, charts, and diagrams. For more information about creating tables, see Chapter 5, “Organize information in columns and tables.”  

# Structure content for accessibility  

If you are designing your document with accessibility in mind, be aware that screen readers and other assistive devices access content linearly—from left to right, row by row—whereas you might expect a person looking at the table to read its content from top to bottom, column by column. Some screen readers have a table reading mode that can help to ameliorate this problem, so if you’re arranging content by using a simple table layout, this won’t present as much of an issue (although the content meaning might still be less clear than when presented in normal text or in a list). If you create a fancy table layout that includes cells of varying heights and widths, with some merged cells and some split cells, it’s likely that the screen reader will access and deliver the content out of order. Keep this in mind if you intend to deliver your content in an electronic format, and certainly if your organization is required to adhere to accessibility standards.  

# To create a nested table  

1. In a document, position the cursor where you want to insert the nested table. 2. On the Insert tab, in the Tables group, select the Table button. 3. In the Insert Table gallery, select the box corresponding to the size of table you want for the container table.  


# Tip  

Press $\mathrm{Ctrl+C}$ to copy the selected content to the Clipboard.  

7. In the container table, right-click the left table cell, and then under Paste Options, select the Nest Table button to insert the table you copied into the cell and adjust the height of the container table to fit the nested table.   
8. Create or locate the second table you want to nest within the container table, and then cut or copy the table to the Clipboard.   
9. In the container table, select the right table cell, and then on the Home tab, in the Clipboard group, select Paste to insert the second table as a nested table.  

# Tip  

Press $\mathrm{Ctrl+V}$ to paste the most recently copied content from the Clipboard.  

To format a nested table  

1. Point to the container table, and then click or tap the table selector that appears just outside of its upper-left corner to select the table. (Be sure you select the container table and not the nested table.)   
2. On the Design tool tab, in the Borders group, in the Borders list, select No Border to remove the borders from the container cells.  

# KEY POINTS  

If you take the time to apply heading styles to a document, you can use the document’s outline to rearrange its sections, either in Outline view or in the Navigation pane.   
You can position an object in relation to the text that surrounds it and in relation to other objects on the page.   
By using tables in creative ways, you can place information in non-linear arrangements for easy comparison or analysis.

7. Close the document, saving your changes if you want.  

# Review and finalize documents  

CHAPTER 11 Collaborate on documents  

CHAPTER 12 Finalize and distribute documents  

# MARK UP DOCUMENTS  

Comments and tracked changes are collectively referred to as markup. Markup is used during the content-development and review processes and is particularly useful for bringing changes, suggestions, and comments to the attention of multiple members of a collaborative authoring group.  

# Insert comments  

A comment is a note attached to an anchor within the text. The anchor can be text or any type of object, or simply a location; wherever it is, Word displays the comment in the right margin of the document.  

![](images/31465cdca109acda157d77693fe1b35ea5971aaef7faeb081900eb80a645497d.jpg)  

# https://avxhm.se/blogs/hill0  

Each comment is inside a container that is fully visible when the comment is active (when you point to or select it). Comment containers are referred to as balloons. Balloons can be used for the display of various types of markup.  

You can insert comments for many reasons, such as to ask questions, make suggestions, provide reference information, or explain edits. You insert and work with comments by using the commands in the Comments group on the Review tab and on the Comments menu at the right end of the ribbon.  

![](images/cbbb016e2687463fd3e197b1336c9650f597de633659049b185a36fe82bd4ba9.jpg)  
The commands in the Comments group make it easy to navigate and remove comments  

Multiple people can insert comments in a document. Word assigns a color to each person’s comments and uses that color for markup associated with insertions, deletions, and formatting changes. The color is assigned by user name, so if two people have the same user name, their markup will be the same color.  

If you prefer to select specific colors and effects for comments and various types of markup, you can do so.  

https://avxhm.se/blogs/hill0  

![](images/3abcfda542ee0fac23a7e0219de49fd50b0b3564fdb9067615657fca13f11ff1.jpg)  
You can modify the types of changes that are tracked and the markup colors  


# Tip  

Display documents in Print Layout view so that all the collaboration commands are available.  

# To insert a comment  

1. Select the text or object you want to anchor the comment to.   
2. Do either of the following:  

https://avxhm.se/blogs/hill0  

1. On the Review tab, in the Comments group, select New Comment.   
2. On the ribbon, select Comments, and then select New Comment.  

3. In the comment balloon that appears in the right margin or in the Revisions pane, enter or paste your comment.  

# Tip  

Comments are usually simple text but can include other elements and formatting such as images and active hyperlinks.  

To specify the color of comments that you insert in any document  

1. On the Review tab, select the Tracking dialog box launcher to open the Track Changes Options dialog box.   
2. Select Advanced Options to open the Advanced Track Changes Options dialog box.   
3. Select the arrow to the right of the Comments list to display a list of colors, and scroll the list to display the options.  

![](images/189242bac967c81560a61a598e76cf4d14a902f3dcfdbbac3d3261c4e8b6cd5e.jpg)  
The available comment colors are independent of the document color scheme and do not change  

4. In the Comments list, select the color you want to use for all the comments you insert in Word documents on the current computer.  

5. Select OK in each open dialog box to close them and save your change.  

# Track changes  

When two or more people collaborate on a document, one person usually creates and “owns” the document, and the others review it—adding or revising content to make it more accurate, logical, or readable. When reviewing a document in Word, you can track your changes so they are available for review and retain the original text for comparison or reversion. You manage change tracking from the Tracking group on the Review tab.  

A shaded button indicates that change tracking is active  

# Tip  

Turning on the change tracking feature tracks changes in only the active document, not in any other open documents.  

Word tracks insertions and deletions and the movement and formatting of content. When you display a document in All Markup view, tracked changes are indicated by different font colors and formatting. The default formatting is as follows:  

 Insertions are in the reviewer-specific color and underlined. Deletions are in the reviewer-specific color and crossed out. Formatting changes are indicated in balloons in the markup area.   
 Moves are green and double-underlined. All changes are indicated in the left margin by a vertical line.  

![](images/d5c03f55e4a6c44219433d57a66b256dc5f10595388138677cc05607d19ba84d.jpg)  

Moved text is green, and a double underline indicates its new location  

As with comments, multiple people can track changes in a document. Word assigns a color to each person’s changes and uses that color to format inserted and deleted text. If you prefer to select a color for your own changes, you can do so. You can also modify the formatting that indicates each type of change. For example, you could have Word indicate inserted text by formatting it as bold, italic, or with a double underline. Note, however, that this change would be valid only for your profile on the computer you make the change on and would not affect change formatting on other computers.  

If you want to ensure that other reviewers track their changes to a document, you can turn on and lock the change-tracking feature and (optionally) require that reviewers enter a password to turn it off.  




# To unlock change tracking  

1. On the Review tab, in the Tracking group, select the Track Changes arrow, and then select Lock Tracking.  

2. In the Unlock Tracking dialog box, enter the password you assigned when you enabled this feature, and then select OK.  

![](images/3d87c8508da9a9efcb57a08fbfc6686c9ad5b9293d55099c6606e8fcfec984e8.jpg)  

Unlocking tracking doesn’t turn off change tracking; you must do that separately  

# DISPLAY AND REVIEW DOCUMENT MARKUP  

After reviewers provide feedback by making changes and entering comments, you can review the tracked changes and comments and choose how you would like to process them.  

# Display markup  

Usually you would display and review all types of markup at one time—insertions, deletions, moves, formatting changes, and comments. However, if you prefer, you can choose to display only certain types of markup, or only markup from specific reviewers.  

Word 2019 has four basic Display For Review options that govern the display of tracked changes in a document. The settings are as follows:  

Simple Markup This default markup view displays a red vertical line in the left margin adjacent to each tracked change. Markup is hidden. All Markup This view displays a gray vertical line in the left margin adjacent to each tracked change, and formats inserted, deleted, and moved content to reflect the settings in the Advanced Track Changes Options dialog box.  


# The individual markup display options  

After you select a Display For Review option, you can additionally filter the display of markup in these ways:  

You can individually control the display of comments, insertions and deletions, and formatting. You can show all markup inline or in balloons, or keep comments in balloons and insertions, deletions, and moves inline.   
 You can display or hide markup by reviewer.  

If you prefer to display all comments and tracked changes in a document at one time, you can do so in the Revisions pane. By default, this pane opens to the left of the document text (and to the right of the Navigation pane, if that is open) at the same height as the document content area. If you want to, you can dock it on the right side of the window instead.  

![](images/c259853eb26651e4a930a6d69b95975162d4034e2882ad9ee806e958ac4c74db.jpg)  

Information about the number and type of revisions is available at the top of the Revisions pane  

From the ribbon, you can also display the Revisions pane horizontally. By default, the horizontal pane stretches across the bottom of the Word app window. If you prefer, you can drag it to the top of the window.  

When the Revisions pane is docked, the content pane becomes narrower or shorter to make space for the pane. You can undock the pane so that it floats independently of the app window and doesn’t take space away from the content pane. The floating pane has a vertical format, but you can change its height and width to fit wherever it’s convenient.  

The best display location depends on the amount of space you have available on your device screen.  

To change the display of markup in a document  To switch between Simple Markup view and All Markup view, select the red or gray vertical line in the margin to the left of any tracked change.  


# Tip  

A check mark to the left of a markup type indicates that elements of that type are visible in views of the document that display those elements.  

To display only markup by a specific person  

1. On the Review tab, in the Tracking group, select Show Markup. 2. In the Show Markup list, select Specific People, and then select the name of any reviewer whose comments you don’t want to display.  

To display individual comments in Simple Markup view  

Select a comment icon to display the comments on that line in comment balloons.   
Point to a comment icon to highlight the comments on that line in the colors associated with the comments’ authors.  

# Tip  

The reviewer name is taken from the user information stored with the user account. If you’re signed in to Word with a Microsoft account, Word tracks revisions by the name associated with your Microsoft account. If the instance of Word you’re working in is not linked to a Microsoft account, you can change the stored user information on the General page of the Word Options dialog box. Changing your user information affects revision tracking only when you aren’t signed in with a Microsoft account.  

# To display the Revisions pane  

On the Review tab, in the Tracking group, select the Reviewing Pane button (not its arrow).  

Selecting the button opens the Revisions pane in its most recent location. The default location in each new Word session is to the left of the page.  


# Review and respond to comments  

All the comments in a document are available for review, regardless of who created them. You can scroll through a document and review the comments as you come to them, or you can jump from comment to comment by selecting buttons on the ribbon or using the commands on the Comments menu.  

# Tip  

If a document contains both comments and tracked changes, selecting the Next or Previous button in the Changes group on the Review tab moves sequentially among these elements, whereas selecting the Next or Previous button in the Comments group or Comments menu moves only among comments.  

When reviewing comments, you can take the following actions:  

Respond to individual comments to provide further information or request clarification.  

Mark individual comments as Resolved to indicate that you’ve processed them, and retain them for later reference. Delete individual comments that you no longer require.   
 Filter the comments by author.   
 Delete all visible comments at the same time.   
Delete all comments in the document at the same time.  

The ability to mark comments as Resolved is a useful feature. Marking a comment as Resolved leaves the comment intact but minimizes and recolors the comment elements so that it doesn’t distract from the document content in the way that an active comment does.  

![](images/08a5896de8da022bd1f5605cd337cfc23dbc21e7ecbc309f49d913bb15eaad9a.jpg)  

An example of a tracked comment before and after being marked as Resolved  

To move among only comments  

On the Review tab, in the Comments group, select the Next or Previous button to jump from balloon to balloon. On the Comments menu at the right end of the ribbon, select Previous or Next. In the Revisions pane, select any comment to move to that comment in the document.  Scroll through the document to visually locate comment balloons.  

To activate a comment for editing  

Select the comment balloon.  

# To respond to a comment  

1. In the upper-right corner of the comment balloon, select the Reply to Comment icon to create an indented response marked with your name and the time and date. Or Right-click the comment, and then select Reply to Comment.   
2. Enter your response to the comment, and then click away from the comment balloon to finish.  

To mark a comment as Resolved or reactivate a Resolved comment  

Right-click the comment highlight (in the text) or balloon (in the margin), and then select Resolve Comment.  

# To delete a comment  

Select the comment balloon, and then select the Delete button in the Comments group.   
Right-click the comment balloon, and then select Delete Comment. Right-click the comment highlight (in the text), and then select Delete Comment.  

# Review and process tracked changes  

As with comments, you can scroll through a document and review insertions, deletions, content moves, and formatting changes as you come to them, or you can jump from change to change by selecting buttons on the ribbon or using the Revisions pane. You also have the option of accepting or rejecting multiple changes at the same time.  

Here are the typical scenarios for reviewing and processing changes that you might consider:  

Display a document in Simple Markup view or No Markup view so you’re viewing the final content. If you are happy with the document content in that view, accept all the changes at the same time.   
Display a document in All Markup view. Scan the individual changes visually. Individually reject any change that doesn’t meet your requirements. As you complete the review of a section that meets your requirements, select the content of that section and approve all the changes within your selection. Display a document in All Markup view. Move to the first change. Accept or reject the change to move to the next. (You can perform both actions with one click.)  

When reviewing tracked changes, you can take the following actions:  

Accept or reject individual changes. Select a section of content and accept or reject all changes therein at the same time. Filter the changes and then accept or reject all visible changes at the same time.  Accept or reject all changes in the document at the same time.  

To move among tracked changes and comments  

On the Review tab, in the Changes group, select   
the Next or Previous button.   
In the Revisions pane, select any change or comment to move to it in the document.  

To display the time and author of a tracked change Point to any revision in the text to display a ScreenTip identifying the name of the reviewer who made the change, and when the change was made.  

To incorporate a selected change into the document and move to the next change  

 On the Review tab, in the Changes group, select the Accept button. Or 1. On the Review tab, in the Changes group, select the Accept arrow. 2. In the Accept list, select Accept and Move to Next.  

To incorporate a selected change into the document and remain in the same location  

Right-click the change, and then select Accept Deletion or Accept Insertion.  On the Review tab, in the Accept list, select Accept This Change.  

To remove the selected change, restore the original text, and move to the next change  

 On the Review tab, in the Changes group, select the Reject button.   
 On the Review tab, in the Reject list, select Reject and Move to Next.  

To remove the selected change, restore the original text, and remain in the same location  

Right-click the change, and then select Reject Deletion or Reject Insertion. On the Review tab, in the Reject list, select Reject This Change.  

To accept or reject all the changes in a section of text  

Select the text. Then do either of the following:   
On the Review tab, in the Changes group, select the Accept button or the Rejectbutton.   
Right-click the selected text, and then select Accept Change or Reject Change.  

To accept or reject all the changes in a document  

 On the Review tab, in the Accept list, select Accept All Changes.   
 On the Review tab, in the Reject list, select Reject All Changes.  

To accept or reject all the changes of a certain type or from a certain reviewer  

Configure the review display settings to display only the changes you want to accept or reject. Then do either of the following:  On the Review tab, in the Accept list, select Accept All Changes Shown.  On the Review tab, in the Reject list, select Reject All Changes Shown.  

It’s a good idea to check for spelling issues in a document after you finish processing changes because, for example, it’s easy to accidentally end up with a missing or extra space in the document. If the Check Spelling As You Type option is on (as it is by default), you can scroll through the document and visually scan for wavy red underlines that indicate suspected spelling errors or double blue underlines that indicate suspected grammar errors. To be entirely thorough, you can run the Check Document tool and respond to each issue it identifies.  

SEE ALSO For more information about checking spelling and grammar, see “Locate and correct text errors” in Chapter 12, “Finalize and distribute documents.”  

# COMPARE AND COMBINE DOCUMENTS  

Sometimes you might want to compare several versions of the same document. Word supports two types of document-version comparison:  

· Comparing a document to a separate copy of the document. Comparing a document to a previous version of the same document.  

# Compare and combine separate copies of a document  

If you have sent a document out for review by several colleagues, you might want to compare their edited versions with the original document. Or if you’ve made changes to a document and you want to compare it to a previous version of the document, you can do that, too.  

Instead of comparing multiple open documents visually, you can tell Word to compare the documents and either move the changes from one document into the other or create a new document that contains the changes from both documents.  

By default, when you compare documents, Word generates a composite document that shows all the differences between the two documents as tracked changes. If you want to review the specific changes and the before-and-after versions independently, you can display the source documents in the same window.  

![](images/8b5387c4e23a1726f99dce42bf22ee9fab262fdaabfce12ae3ad85e5976ea89b.jpg)  
Scrolling any version of the documents you’re comparing or combining scrolls all three  

If you’re working on a document that is stored in a SharePoint document library, the Compare menu also includes options for comparing the open document to other versions of itself.  

# Tip  

Word can’t compare or combine documents that have Protection turned on to restrict changes.  

You can compare any two documents. To compare multiple edited documents to one original, combine all the edited documents into one, and then compare them with the original.  

To compare or combine two documents and annotate changes  

1. Start from a blank document or any existing document.   
2. On the Review tab, in the Compare group, select Compare to track changes from only one document or Combine to track changes from both documents.   
3. In the Compare Documents or Combine Documents dialog box, under Original document, select the arrow to expand the alphabetical list of documents you’ve recently worked with.   
4. If the document you want to designate as the first document appears in the list, select it. If not, select Browse (the first item in the list) to display the Open dialog box. In the dialog box, navigate to the document you want, select it, and then select Open.   
5. Use the same technique in the Revised document area to select the document you want to designate as the second document.   
6. In the Label changes with box or boxes, enter the name or names you want Word to assign as the reviewer when marking differences between the documents.  

# Tip  

When comparing documents, you specify the reviewer for only the revised document; when combining documents, you specify reviewers for both documents.  

![](images/202c264b094553803aca0bf5eeafd078a38cfa87825bf396095889070b3446e1.jpg)  

You can indicate what types of differences to identify and how to label them  

7. If the dialog box doesn’t include the Comparison settings and Show changes areas, select the More button to display them.  

8. In the Comparison settings area of the dialog box, select the check boxes of the content differences you want to annotate.  

# Tip  

By default, Word marks changes at the word level in a new document. You have the option to show changes at the character level and to show them in one of the two documents rather than in a third document. Until you’re comfortable with the compare and combine operations, it’s safest to retain the default settings in the Show Changes area.  

9. In the Compare Documents or Combine Documents dialog box, select OK to create the combined document.  

# Tip  

If you compare documents that contain conflicting formatting, a message box will ask you to confirm which document’s formatting should be used.  

# To hide or display comparison source documents  

In the Compare Result document window, on the Review tab, in the Compare group, select Show Source Documents, and then select Hide Source Documents or the option to show one or both source documents.  

![](images/70cceb0c5416ae773cd6893bc2495644b8c892455a636ac66217023070976b47.jpg)  

Word 2019 hides the source documents by default  

# Compare separate versions of a document  

Word automatically saves a temporary copy of your open documents every 10 minutes. Automatically saved versions of the document are displayed in the Manage Document area of the Info page of the Backstage view.  

![](images/6a37f9b6cc9181f32c51ba930b636ab36597091f97af68f5ace82310302fc365.jpg)  

You can easily review or recover an earlier version of a document  

# To display a previous version of a document  

On the Info page of the Backstage view, in the Manage Document list, select the version you want to display.  

To compare a document to a previous version  

1. Display the previous version of the document.   
2. On the information bar at the top of the previous version, select Compare.  

To roll back to a previous version of a document  

1. Display the previous version of the document.   
2. On the information bar at the top of the previous version, select the Restore button.  

To change how often Word automatically saves document recovery versions  

1. Display the Save page of the Word Options dialog box.   
2. In the Save AutoRecover information every box, enter the number of minutes Word should allow to pass before saving a recovery version of the document.   
3. Select OK to close the dialog box.  

# CONTROL CONTENT CHANGES  

Sometimes you’ll want to allow people to display the contents of a document but not make changes to it. Other times you’ll want to allow changes, but only of certain types, or only if they’re tracked for your review. This section includes information about ways that you can protect the content of a document.  

# Tip  

When considering content protection options, keep in mind that storing documents within a document-management system that has version control can save you a lot of trouble. Word 2019 includes a built-in version-tracking system that you can use to compare and restore previous versions of a document that are stored on your computer. Microsoft SharePoint document libraries provide access to previous versions of documents checked in by any team member. (At the time of this writing, SharePoint Online document libraries default to tracking 500 versions of each document.)  

# Restrict actions  

To prevent people from introducing inconsistent formatting or unwanted changes into a document, you can restrict the types of changes that an individual document permits, in the following ways:  

Restrict formatting You can limit formatting changes to a specific list of styles that you select, or to the recommended minimum style set, which consists of all the styles needed by Word for features such as tables of contents. (The recommended minimum set doesn’t necessarily include all the styles used in the document.) Restricting formatting prevents anyone from adding or applying styles that you don’t want in your document.  

For more information about styles, see “Apply character formatting” and “Apply builtin styles to text” in Chapter 4, “Modify the structure and appearance of text.”  

Restrict editing You can limit changes to comments, tracked changes, or form field content, or you can permit no changes at all.  

You can implement these types of restrictions from the Restrict Editing pane. When restrictions are turned on, the Restrict Editing pane provides information about the actions you can perform in the document. Ribbon buttons that apply restricted formats are unavailable (grayed out).  

![](images/b35b19b6f2d776c25ce34d6d734d225be5d1c2fb3b67f5381be541a70d2d5efc.jpg)  

You can restrict formatting so that other people don’t make unapproved content or formatting changes  


# Restrict access by using a password  

Sometimes, you might want to allow only certain people to open and change a document. The simplest way to do this for an individual document is to assign a password to protect the file. Then, anyone who wants to modify the document must enter a password when opening it.  

You can assign a password to a document while working in the document or when saving the document. Word offers two levels of password protection:  

Encrypted The document is saved in such a way that people who do not know the password cannot open it at all.   
Unencrypted The document is saved in such a way that only people who know the password can open it, make changes, and save the file. People who don’t know the password can open a read-only version. If they make changes and want to save them, they have to save the document with a different name or in a different location, preserving the original.  

![](images/041c106816ee8d9546b832e1f6c76680a375ce5482c48e5c4f67bbdefa041197.jpg)  

Assigning a password to open a document encrypts the document; assigning a password to modify the document does not encrypt it  


# Tip  

As you enter the password, Word obscures it for security.  

5. In the Confirm Password dialog box, enter the same password in the Reenter password to modify box, and then select OK to set the password.   
6. In the Save As dialog box, select Save. If Word prompts you to overwrite the original document, select Yes.

# COAUTHOR DOCUMENTS  

Whether you work for a large company or a small organization, you might need to collaborate with other people on the development of a document. Regardless of the circumstances, it can be difficult to keep track of different versions of a document produced by different people. If you store a document in a shared location such as a SharePoint document library or Microsoft OneDrive folder, multiple people can edit the document simultaneously.  

After you save a document to a shared location, you can open and edit the document just as you would if it were stored on your computer. Other people can also open and edit the document either by browsing to it or from an invitation that you send. This facilitates efficient collaboration between people regardless of location, schedule, or time zone.  

The process of inviting people to edit a shared file depends on the storage location. The file is automatically shared with other people who have access to the SharePoint document library or OneDrive folder. You can invite other people to edit or view the file from the Share pane.  

![](images/af6b2df8c9af1ac1c37382b06ef1cfb3e044a49599e6c0deaa0367427e492f61.jpg)  

The Share pane functionality varies depending on the document-storage location  

When other people open a shared file for editing, Word alerts you to their presence by displaying their user badge (a round badge displaying a photo or initials) on the ribbon.  

![](images/ee98fc8753cc6dfebcef5824637d379789b982d9d835107cb995c208bfeea94f.jpg)  
An alert appears as each editor opens the document  

Clicking an editor’s user badge displays options for tracking the work that person is doing in the document and communicating with him or her. If the file is stored on SharePoint, you have the option of chatting with other editors directly in the document.  

![](images/c14542b386e64f3ee093c864d3814cd1662d94aae85da0189da4e41c0dcc8a1a.jpg)  

# The Chat button is present only when other people are editing the document  

Word keeps track of the content that people are editing and locks paragraphs so only one editor can work in each paragraph at a time. If you try to edit a paragraph that someone else is working in, Word shows you who is editing it, so you can contact that person if you want to.  

![](images/cdbe16e39239b0c7ce5b579b6d3924c36fac95a785b5e10d1b6fccf23868cb6b.jpg)  

# Word indicates the areas of the document that are being edited  

When you turn on change tracking in a document, it is on for all editors. If each person working in the document tracks his or her changes, the tracked changes remain available so that the document owner can accept or reject them when the team has finished working on the document.  

To make a document available for coauthoring  

 Save the document to a SharePoint document library or OneDrive folder. To begin coauthoring a document 1. If the document is stored in a SharePoint document library, do NOT check it out. 2. Open the document directly from the document library or OneDrive folder. 3. Edit the document as you would normally. Other editors can join the document from the same location.  

To display the Share pane  

 On the ribbon, to the right of the Tell me box, select the Share button. On the Share page of the Backstage view, in the right pane of the Share with Peoplepage, select the Share with People button.  

To invite other people to edit a file stored in OneDrive  

1. Display the Share pane.   
2. In the Invite people box, enter the names or email addresses of the people you want to invite to edit the document.   
3. In the permissions list, select Can edit to allow the recipients to make changes to the document.   
4. In the message box, enter any message you want to include in the sharing invitation.   
5. Select Share to send an email message that contains a link to the document on OneDrive.  


# To move to the location in a document where another editor is working  

1. On the ribbon, select the user badge of the editor you want to locate.  

![](images/464a15c20d7e87b092aff47c13402b70b928e8d3a8561adc38dd24d47fc2e1b3.jpg)  

You can easily locate edits other people are making  

2. On the menu, select Go to Edit Location.  

To begin a chat in a document stored on SharePoint  

On the ribbon, select the user badge of the editor you want to chat with, and then select Chat.  

# KEY POINTS  

 You can insert comments in a document to ask questions or explain suggested edits. You can track the revisions you make to a document without losing the original text. Word assigns different revision-tracking colors to multiple reviewers, so you can easily identify change sources.   
 You can merge multiple versions of a document so that the changes in all versions are tracked in one document.   
 If only specific people should work on a document, you can protect it with a password. You can also restrict the types of changes people can make or force all changes to be tracked.   
 Multiple people can simultaneously edit a document stored on a SharePoint site or on OneDrive.

# Coauthor documents  

There is no practice task for this topic because it requires that documents be stored in a shared location.  

# LOCATE AND CORRECT TEXT ERRORS  

In the days of handwritten and typewritten documents, people might have tolerated a typographical or grammatical error or two because correcting such errors without creating a mess was difficult. Word-processing apps such as Word have built-in spelling and grammar checkers, so documents that contain these types of errors are likely to reflect badly on their creators.  

# Tip  

Although Word can help you eliminate misspellings and grammatical errors, its tools are not infallible. You should always read through your document to catch any problems that the Word tools don’t detect—for example, homonyms such as their, there, and they’re.  

Word provides three tools to help you avoid editorial errors:  

AutoCorrect This feature corrects common spelling and grammatical errors, replaces text codes with mathematical symbols, and automatically applies formatting based on text cues. AutoCorrect has a built-in list of frequently misspelled words and their correct spellings. If you frequently misspell a word that AutoCorrect doesn’t change, you can add it to the list in the AutoCorrect dialog box. If you deliberately enter a word that is on the AutoCorrect list and don’t want to accept the AutoCorrect change, you can reverse the correction.  

![](images/ad7d5506f34eba5952ce520e995be4ea3bda61bd542b01cb8029faa12a5fd25c.jpg)  


# Tip  

Word’s grammar checker helps identify phrases and clauses that don’t follow traditional grammatical rules, but it’s not always accurate. It’s easy to get in the habit of ignoring blue double underlines. However, it’s wise to scrutinize them all to be sure that your documents don’t contain any embarrassing mistakes.  

Editor pane This pane, which replaces the Spelling & Grammar pane available in previous versions of Word, identifies the number of spelling, grammar, and wording issues it finds in the document. When you select a spelling or grammar error in the document, the Editor pane displays possible alternative spellings or word choices. You can also display information about the grammar rule that applies to the flagged text.  

When you select flagged text in the Clarity And Conciseness area of the Editor pane, the pane displays suggestions for better word choices.  

![](images/b8cfbe29c47b11a6af38e3bc8ba8313aa425aa1056029c7475110fc14c8d79bc.jpg)  

Editorial issues are underlined in the text and managed from the Editor pane  

Word saves your responses to suggested spelling and grammar changes with the document. If you choose to ignore a flagged error, the error will not be reflagged when you check again in the same document.  

From the Grammar Settings dialog box, you can specify the grammatical issues and refinements you want the Editor to check for. This dialog box contains several categories of options for grammar and refinement.  

You can choose to check for the following grammar issues:  

 Academic Degrees   
 Comma Splice   
 Possessive and Plural Forms   
 Adjective Used Instead of Adverb   
 Comparative Use   
 Punctuation   
 Adverb Instead of Adjective   
 Correlative Conjunction Mismatch   
 Question Mark Missing   
 Agreement Within Noun Phrases   
 Date Formatting   
 Redundant Colon   
 An And Confusion   
 Embarrassing Words   
 Redundant Comma Before Complement Clause   
 Capitalization   
 Hyphenation   
 Redundant Comma Following Subject   
 Capitalization of “March” and “May”   
 Incorrect Auxiliary   
 Redundant Question Mark   
 Capitalization of Personal Titles   
 Incorrect Pronoun Case   
 Repeated Auxiliary   
 Comma After Greetings   
 Incorrect Reflexive Pronoun Use   
 Spacing   
 Commas Around Descriptive Clause Incorrect Verb Form   
 Subject-Verb Agreement   
 Comma Before Quotations   
 Incorrect Verb Form After Auxiliary   
 Too Many Determiners Comma Missing After Introductory Phrase   
. Indefinite Article Use of Plain Verb Form Comma with Conjunctive Adverbs Indirect Questions Use of the Word “Lack”   
 Comma with Conjunction   
 Misheard Phrases   
 Use of “Will” and “Would”   
 Commonly Confused Phrases   
 Missing Comma Verb Use   
 Commonly Confused Words Multiple Modals  

You can choose to check for these types of clarity and conciseness issues:  

Adverb Placement   
Jargon   
Use of Euphemisms   
Complex Words   
Nominalizations   
Wordiness   
Conjunction Overuse   
Passive Voice   
Words Expressing Uncertainty   
Double Negation   
Passive Voice with Unknown Actor   
Words in Split Infinitives (more than one)  

The following table lists the other refinements you can choose to check for.

# Tip  

You can specify the behavior of the spelling and grammar checker from the Proofing page of the Word Options dialog box. For information, see “Manage proofing options” in Chapter 16, “Customize options and the user interface.”  

# To reverse an AutoCorrect correction  

 Before entering any new text, do any of the following:  On the Quick Access Toolbar, select the Undo button. Press $\mathbf{C}\mathbf{trl}{+}\mathbf{Z}$ . Point to the bar that appears below the word, and then select Undo.  

To display the Editor pane  

 On the Review tab, in the Proofing group, select Check Document.  Press $\mathbf{F}_{7}$ . To fine-tune the level of detail the Editor pane checks for  

1. Display the Editor pane.   
2. Below the Refinements text box, select Settings to display the Proofing page of the Word Options dialog box.   
3. Under When correcting spelling and grammar in Word, select Settings to open the Grammar Settings dialog box.  

# Tip  

The default selected check boxes in the Grammar Settings dialog box change depending on whether you have Grammar & Refinements or Grammar selected as the Writing Style.  

4. In the Grammar Settings dialog box, below each section, select or clear the check boxes. In the Punctuation Conventions section, select don’t check, inside, or outside from the list.  

5. Select OK in both the Grammar Settings and Word Options dialog box to close them.  

# To review flagged text from within the body of the document  

1. Right-click any word or phrase marked with an underscore. Word displays suggestions to correct or improve the current spelling or wording at the top of the shortcut menu.  

![](images/043f29e518aab6e588baefefa66646c132027d8da5a508401d50313eb17448d4.jpg)  
The shortcut menu lists spelling options from the dictionary and related actions  


# Tip  

Typically, the issues you might want to ignore are those for which you consistently select Ignore when running a spelling and grammar check from the Review tab.  

# Set mathematical AutoCorrect options  

If you frequently create documents that contain mathematical formulas, you don’t have to insert mathematical symbols by using the ribbon buttons. Instead, you can enter a predefined combination of characters and have Word automatically replace it with a corresponding math symbol. For example, if you enter \infty in an equation field, Word replaces the characters with the infinity symbol $(\infty)$ .  

This replacement is performed by the Math AutoCorrect feature. You can view all the predefined mathematical symbol descriptions by selecting the Math AutoCorrect button in the Equation Options dialog box, or by selecting AutoCorrect Options on the Proofing page of the Word Options dialog box, and then selecting the Math AutoCorrect tab.  

![](images/01073ee534654a7970191188bb9bd0e592f6292acfab9bbc315883f8d346c967.jpg)  

The Math AutoCorrect feature simplifies the process of inserting mathematical symbols  

You can create custom Math AutoCorrect entries in the same way you create text AutoCorrect entries. For information, see Chapter 16, “Customize options and the user interface.”  

To hide underlines that indicate spelling or grammar errors or clarity issues  

1. Display the Proofing page of the Word Options dialog box. 2. In the Exceptions for list, do either of the following:

The dictionary includes words that you’ve added from the Editor pane, from the shortcut menu, or manually  

# PREVIEW AND ADJUST PAGE LAYOUT  

Working on your document in the default Print Layout view means that you always know how the document content will appear on the printed page. While you’re working in the document, you can use the commands in the Page Setup group on the  

Layout tab to adjust the page settings (such as the margins and page orientation) to best suit your content and delivery method. If you’re planning to deliver the document at a page size other than the default, you can format the document to display and print correctly by changing the paper size.  

Although the layout of each page is visible in Print Layout view, it’s also a good idea to preview the whole document before you print it. This gives you more of a high-level overview of the document than when you’re working directly in the content. Previewing is essential for multipage documents but is helpful even for onepage documents. You can preview a document as it will appear when printed, on the Print page of the Backstage view. The preview area shows exactly how each page of the document will look when printed on the selected printer.  

![](images/9b7d1ff18e5c1ea8b86a7a977a06825e1e63ae2c38564ca107826706162e2477.jpg)

The Print page displays a preview of the document as it will appear when printed  

# Tip  

Press $\mathrm{Ctrl+P}$ to display the Print page of the Backstage view. For more information about keyboard shortcuts, see “Keyboard shortcuts” at the end of this book.  

If you don’t like what appears in the preview pane of the Print page, you don’t have to leave the Backstage view to make adjustments. The left pane of the Print page provides access to many of the commands available in the Page Setup group on the Page Layout tab, allowing you to change the following document settings while previewing their effect on the printed page:  

Orientation You can switch the direction in which a page is laid out on the paper. The default orientation is Portrait, in which the page is taller than it is wide. You can set the orientation to Landscape, in which the page is wider than it is tall.   
Paper size You can switch to one of the paper sizes available for the selected printer. Margins Changing the margins of a document changes where information can appear on each page. You can select one of Word’s predefined sets of top, bottom, left, and right margins, or set custom margins.  

All the pages of a document have the same orientation and margins unless you divide the document into sections. Then each section can have independent orientation and margin settings.  



# To modify document margins  

![](images/985725944f5e462272dc363e5e19269faf955373e05e94f887330c86761b5c51.jpg)  

You can select from predefined margin settings, or you can set your own  

# Tip  

While editing a document, you can display the same Margins menu by selecting the Margins button in the Page Setup group on the Layout tab.  

2. At the bottom of the left pane, select the Page Setup link to display the Margins tab of the Page Setup dialog box.  

![](images/94d5f067dd738101288af23959de06649a65067b90bd90786bf185da435f234f.jpg)  

The Mirror Margins setting is a good choice when you plan to print and bind a double-sided document  

2. From the menu or in the dialog box, configure the margin settings as you want them. The preview area reflects the change.  


# Tip  

Changing the Print Hidden Text option in the Word Options dialog box changes this setting for all documents.  

# CONTROL WHAT APPEARS ON EACH PAGE  

When a document includes more content than will fit between its top and bottom margins, Word creates a new page by inserting a soft page break (a page break that moves if the preceding content changes). If you want to break a page in a place other than where Word would normally break it, you can insert a manual page break (also called a hard page break). As you edit the content of a document, Word changes the location of the soft page breaks but not of any manual page breaks.  


# Tip  

By selecting Keep With Next instead of inserting a page break, you allow the content to move from page to page as long as it stays with the following paragraph. You can apply these options to individual paragraphs, or you can incorporate them into the styles you define for document elements such as headings. For information about styles, see “Create and modify styles” in Chapter 15, “Create custom document elements.”  

When you want to format part of a document differently from the rest—for example, with page layout settings different from those of the surrounding text—you do so by inserting section breaks above and below it. A common example of this is when you need to print a wide table on a page with a Landscape orientation within a report with a Portrait page orientation. Word uses four types of section breaks:  

Next Page Starts the following section on the next page · Continuous Starts a new section without affecting page breaks  Even Page Starts the following section on the next even-numbered page Odd Page Starts the following section on the next odd-numbered page  

When you display hidden formatting marks, a section break appears in Print Layout view as a double-dotted line from the preceding paragraph mark to the margin, with the words Section Break and the type of section break in the middle of the line.  

# Tip  

Formatting selected text in columns automatically inserts section breaks. For more information, see “Present information in columns” in Chapter 5, “Organize information in columns and tables.”  

1.→Create the customerinvoice.   
$2,~\rightarrow$ Send the invoicetothe customer.   
3. $\nrightarrow$ EnterTentativeinthecustomer'sAccessaccountuntil youreceivethecheck· and thecheckhasclearedthebank.

The heading and table move to the next page, after the section break indicator  

You can configure individual page layout, page setup, and headers and footers for each section.

# PREPARE DOCUMENTS FOR ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION  

When a document is complete, you can distribute it in two ways: printed on paper or electronically. When you distribute a printed document, only the printed information is visible to the reader. When you distribute a document electronically, you should ensure that no confidential information is attached to the file and that it can be viewed by the people you’re sending it to. Some of the information attached to the document is available with the document properties on the Info page of the Backstage view. You can change or remove some types of information from this page and more types of information from either the Document Panel or the Properties dialog box.  


# InspectDocument  

Beforepublishing thisfile,be aware thatitcontains  

![](images/6bb42a6eb0cc61f68c1359fce45fbc51f3e36999df4c876430f47b01094264d4.jpg)

■ Custom XML data   
■ Content that people with disabilities are unable to read  

Accessibility Checker Identifies document elements and formatting that might be difficult for people with certain kinds of disabilities to read or for assistive devices such as screen readers to access.  

This tool checks for many common accessibility issues and provides explanations and recommendations for fixing them. You can leave the Accessibility Checker open while you work; its contents will automatically update to indicate the current issues. After you run the Accessibility Checker, information about document content issues is also shown in the Inspect Document area of the Info page of the Backstage view.  



# Tip  

You can choose to retain content identified by the Document Inspector if you know that it is appropriate for distribution.  

6. In the Document Inspector dialog box, select Reinspect, and then select Inspect to verify the removal of the properties and other data you selected.  

7. When you’re satisfied with the results, close the Document Inspector dialog box.  

To inspect a document for accessibility issues  

1. Do either of the following:  

1. On the Info page of the Backstage view, select Check For Issues, and then select Check Accessibility to display the Accessibility Checker pane. 2. On the Review tab, in the Accessibility group, select Check Accessibility. 2. In the Accessibility Checker pane, review the inspection results and make any changes you want to the document. 3. When you are done, do either of the following:  

0. Select the X in the upper-right corner of the Accessibility Checker pane to close the pane.   
1. Leave the pane open to continue checking for accessibility issues as you work with the document.  

To check a document for compatibility with earlier versions of Word  

1. On the Info page of the Backstage view, select the Check Compatibility button to run the Compatibility Checker.   
2. In the Microsoft Word Compatibility Checker dialog box, review the results, make any changes you want, and then select OK.  

# Tip  

By default, Word always checks for compatibility whenever you save a document. If you don’t want Word to do this, clear the Check Compatibility When Saving Documents check box in the Microsoft Word Compatibility Checker dialog box.  

Accessibility issues  

Whenever you create a document that will be distributed electronically, particularly if it will be displayed as a webpage, think about whether its content will be accessible to all the people you want to reach. For example, consider the following:  

Not all people will display the document in Word 2019 or in the same web browser in which you preview it.   
Some people might set their default web browser font sizes larger than usual or display their web browser content at an increased zoom level.   
Some people can’t differentiate changes in color. Others might have their computers configured to display a high-contrast color scheme that changes the default colors of text so they can read it better.   
People with visual impairments might use an assistive device such as a screen reader to “read” content to them from the document or webpage.   
Web browsers might be configured to hide certain page elements.   
A slow connection might prevent the display of large images.  

If you intend to publish the document on a public webpage, consider also whether the terms that your prospective viewers might search for are accessible to search engines.  

There are some things you can do to make a document display more uniformly on screen (or on paper) and be more accessible to assistive devices and internet search engines:  

Use styles to format content, rather than applying manual formatting. This allows readers to move directly to specific headings from the document Navigation pane, and to apply style sets that use legible fonts and high-contrast colors to make content easier to read on the screen.   
Similarly, when specifying colors, use the theme colors so that they change   
appropriately when viewers choose high-contrast themes.   
If your content includes graphics, add a caption to each image and add a written description of the image to the image properties as alternative text (frequently referred to as alt text). The alt text is displayed in place of the image when the image can’t be displayed on screen. It can also be read aloud by screen readers.   
Also to assist screen readers, wrap text around images by using the In Line With Text setting, so that images do not interrupt text. Do not use watermarks or background colors, patterns, or images that might interfere with the readability of the document content.   
Present information in the standard content of the document rather than in text boxes. Content in text boxes might not be accessible to screen readers.   
To ensure that screen readers can access content in the intended reading order, present it in text paragraphs rather than in tabbed lists or tables. If you must present information in a table, follow these guidelines:   
Use the standard table formats—don’t “draw” the table manually, merge or split cells, or nest tables. Variances in the table might cause assistive devices to incorrectly interpret the content.   
If your table will span multiple pages, select the option to repeat the header row so that the headers are both visible and accessible to assistive devices.   
Add alt text and captions to tables in case they are incorrectly displayed or   
interpreted.   
When formatting hyperlinks, provide ScreenTip text.  

SEE ALSO For information about creating ScreenTips for hyperlinks, see the sidebar “Hyperlink to additional resources” in Chapter 13, “Reference content and content sources.”  

# To mark a document as final  

1. On the Info page of the Backstage view, in the Protect Document area, select Protect Document, and then select Mark As Final. A message tells you that the document will be marked as final and then saved.   
2. In the message box, select OK. A message tells you that the document has been marked as final, the status property has been set to Final, and typing, editing commands, and proofing marks are turned off.   
3. In the message box, select OK. The document title bar indicates that the document is read-only (no changes can be saved), and the Protect Document area indicates that the file has been marked as final.

To remove the Final designation and read-only protection from a file that has been marked as final  

 On the information bar, select Edit Anyway. On the Info page of the Backstage view, select Protect Document and then Mark as Final.  

# PRINT AND SEND DOCUMENTS  

When you’re ready to distribute your document to other people, you can do so either by printing it on paper or by sending or posting the file for people to access electronically.  

The available printing options change, depending on the selected printer. This is either the default or the most recently used printer. You can display a list of installed printers on the Print page of the Backstage view.  

![](images/03566dd3c39d11b9500e5c249f48076869516aac1eb72d5e95b9806a9be0d5bd.jpg)  

Apps you can print to, such as Microsoft OneNote, are available with local and network printers  

# Tip  

You can display a ScreenTip that contains information about a printer, such as the printer status, manufacturer, model, and connection method, by selecting it in the Printer list and then pointing to it. You can manage the apps and printers shown on the Printer menu from the Devices And Printers Control Panel window.  

From the Settings area of the Print page, you can specify what part of the document is printed and whether markup (tracked changes) is indicated in the printed document. In addition, you have the option of printing the following information instead of the document content:  

Document properties  

Tracked changes Styles AutoText entries Custom shortcut keys  

# Settings  

![](images/6463173347023dfcae68997b2e7fd2132a33c509ed76cf4565cf46761126f580.jpg)  

You can choose to print all or part of a document, or to print information stored with the document  

You can choose to print a multipage document on one or both sides of the paper. If your printer supports double-sided printing, you have the option of flipping the double-sided page on the long edge or the short edge (depending on how you plan to bind and turn the document pages).  


# Tip  

If your printer has multiple paper trays or a manual paper feeder, you can select the paper source you want to use, on the Paper page of the Page Setup dialog box.  

When Outlook is set as your default email app, you can send a document from Word while you’re working in the file. You have the option of sending a copy of the file as a message attachment or, if the file is stored in a shared location, you can send a link to the file.  


# Tip  

If you have an account with a fax service provider that permits the transmission of fax messages by email, you can select the Send As Internet Fax option and provide the fax number to address the message in the format required by the fax service. For example, if your fax service provider is Contoso and the fax number is (425) 555-0199, the email might be addressed to 14255550199@contoso.com. The fax service relays the message electronically to the recipient’s fax number.

4. If Outlook isn’t already running, Word starts it before generating the email message. Enter your password if you are prompted to do so.  

# KEY POINTS  

Rely on AutoCorrect to correct common misspellings. Correct other spelling, grammatical, and style errors as you enter text, or check the entire document in one pass.   
You should always preview a document before printing it. You can efficiently preview a document and adjust most page layout settings from the Print page of the Backstage view.   
You can insert line breaks, page breaks, and section breaks to control the way content breaks on and across pages. Before distributing a document electronically, you can use the Document Inspector to remove information that you don’t want other people to see. You can use the Accessibility Checker and Compatibility Checker to ensure that your document content is available to all readers. You can print a document to a local or network printer, and configure the printer settings, from the Print page of the Backstage view. From the Share page of the Backstage view, you can send a document as an attachment to an email message. You can send the original document or, if yo want to ensure that the document appears to recipients exactly as you have laid it out, you can have Word create and send a PDF file or XPS file.

# INSERT BOOKMARKS AND CROSS-REFERENCES  

Word provides two tools you can use to jump easily to designated places within the same document: bookmarks and cross-references.  

Whether the document you’re reading was created by you or by someone else, you can insert bookmarks to flag information to which you might want to return later. Like a physical bookmark, a Word bookmark marks a specific named place in a document. Each bookmark is identified by a unique name. (Bookmark names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscore characters.)  

You can quickly go directly to any bookmark from the Bookmark dialog box, from the Go To tab of the Find And Replace dialog box, or from a hyperlink. Bookmarks are hidden by default, but you can configure Word options to display their markers. The markers indicate only the bookmark locations. Bookmarks that mark individual locations are indicated by large, gray I-beams. Bookmarks that mark spans of text are indicated by gray square brackets at the beginning and end.  

![](images/2909f9b743f9b72dbe0d86464f9e13aeb146365659412cd863f46535a579c7b9.jpg)  

# I-beams and brackets indicate bookmarks  

You can create cross-references to bookmarks, headings, figures, tables, numbered items, footnotes, endnotes, and equations. Word automatically creates anchors for all these items other than bookmarks. Cross-references can include hyperlinks so that selecting a cross reference in the electronic document takes the reader directly to the specified location.  


# To insert a bookmark  

1. Do either of the following:  

1. Position the cursor in the location where you want to insert the bookmark. This is usually at the beginning of the content you want to reference. 2. Select the text you want to include in the bookmark. 2. On the Insert tab, in the Links group, select the Bookmark button to open the Bookmark dialog box.  

![](images/6a22f9ec7dfa47862822c8689e4bb7bbd4438891bd485060e0a22768f5cd19f8.jpg)  

If other bookmarks exist in the document, the most recent bookmark is selected so you can quickly reinsert it  

3. In the Bookmark name box, enter a name for the bookmark you want to create (or replace the name that is currently in the Bookmark Name box).  

4. Select Add or press Enter.  

# Tip  

Bookmark names cannot contain characters other than letters, numbers, and underscores. If you enter a prohibited character (such as a space or hyphen), the Add button becomes inactive. To name bookmarks with multiple words and maintain readability, either run the words together and capitalize each word (known as camel caps) or replace the spaces with underscores.  

# To display bookmarks in text  

1. From the Backstage view, open the Word Options dialog box, and then select the Advanced page tab.   
2. In the Show document content area of the Advanced page, select the Show bookmarks check box.  

![](images/7cb610e03eba687307c5ba023f37b07c37150ee458a443d9f4eb57de7cd52e9d.jpg)  

You can display bookmark indicators in a document  

3. Select OK.  

To go to any bookmark  

Open the Bookmark dialog box, and then do either of the following:  In the Bookmark name list, double-click the bookmark you want to go to. Select the bookmark you want to go to, and then select Go To.  


# Tip  

Word does not add text to introduce the cross-reference, so it’s a good idea to enter text such as See also before the cross-reference.  

1. On the Insert tab, in the Links group, select the Cross-reference button to open the Cross-reference dialog box.  

![](images/3d7fd11b0f568988b551486acd1522f6cdc4a64c9355902f6ed8938fde45a4a3.jpg)  

You can cross-reference to many types of content  

2. In the Reference type list, select the type of item you want to reference (for example, Heading).   
3. In the Insert reference to list, select the text you want the cross-reference to display. (For example, when cross-referencing to a bookmark, you can display the bookmark text—when the bookmark includes a span of text—the page or paragraph number of the bookmark, or the word above or below depending on the location of the bookmark in relation to the location of the cross-reference.)   
4. If you want the cross-reference to include a hyperlink, select the Insert as hyperlinkcheck box. If you plan to distribute the document only on paper, it isn’t necessary to hyperlink the cross-reference.   
5. In the For which item pane, select the specific item you want to reference.   
6. Select Insert, and then select Close.   
7. Review the cross-reference and add any words or punctuation necessary to assist the reader.  

# Hyperlink to additional resources  

Many documents include URLs of websites the reader can visit to obtain additional information related to the document topic. When a document will be viewed electronically, the URLs can be formatted as hyperlinks so readers can access the websites directly from the document. Hyperlinks can also provide direct access to bookmarks or headings in the document, or to a separate file; or you can use a hyperlink to create a new document or to open a pre-addressed email message window.  

Hyperlinks are most frequently in text format, but you can attach a hyperlink to any object— for example, an image such as a shape, logo, or picture. Selecting the hyperlinked object then takes you directly to the linked location. Editing the object does not disrupt the hyperlink; however, deleting the object also deletes the hyperlink.  

Word automatically adds hyperlink functionality and applies the Hyperlink format when you enter a standard website address and then press the Spacebar or Enter key.  

To attach a hyperlink to text or an object, follow these steps:  

1. Select the text or object that you want to hyperlink from.   
2. On the Insert tab, in the Links group, select the Link button (not the arrow) to open the Insert Hyperlink dialog box (or press $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{K},$ .   
3. In the Link to list, select the type of target you’re linking to. Often this is a webpage or another place in the file.  

![](images/89156b4a047e722cf72b1550a5b6b335d3002f63a132460193238ae978f9fc66.jpg)  

You can link to internal and external locations  

4. Do either of the following, and then select OK:  

1. If you’re linking to a webpage, select Existing File or Web Page in the Link To box and then enter the URL in the Address box.   
2. If you’re linking to a heading or bookmark in the current file, select Place in This Document in the Link To box and then select the target in the Select a place in this document pane.  

To go to a cross-referenced location  In the document, hold down the Ctrl key, and then select the cross-reference.  

# Tip  

Pointing to the inserted cross-reference displays a ScreenTip containing information about the cross-reference target.  


# DISPLAY DOCUMENT INFORMATION IN FIELDS  

A field is a placeholder that tells Word to supply specified information or to perform a specified action in a specified way. You can use fields to insert information that can be updated with the click of a button if the information changes. You can’t enter fields directly in a document by typing; you must tell Word to insert the field you want. One way to do this is from the Field dialog box. This dialog box also allows access to various settings for the selected field type.  

![](images/e71ebe52e4ade7a0dbf97cea1a2299e9232afc29328a20066c5daefedded45e2.jpg)  
The Field dialog box provides a comprehensive list of all the available fields  

More often, however, you will insert preconfigured fields, which you can do by selecting various options on the Insert tab. For example, selecting the Date & Time button in the Text group on the Insert tab opens the Date And Time dialog box, which you can use to insert a date and time field. When you insert a date and time field, Word retrieves the date and time from your computer’s internal calendar or clock. You can set a date and time field to be updated every time you open a document or whenever you save the document, or you can lock the field so it does not update at all.  

![](images/23c24cf8fa67119dfbbbe485c6d850f96593bed22190e3bc808e7c1f88a06eb8.jpg)  
You can specify the date and time format you want  

Another type of preconfigured field you might want to insert in a document—for example, in its header or footer—is one that contains a document property, such as the author, title, or last modification date. You can easily insert this type of information from the Document Property submenu of the Quick Parts menu. (If you edit the contents of the field in the document, the change is carried over to the list of properties displayed on the Info page in Backstage view.)  

![](images/1437f5df0974bf61e5cedeccb3a1a1b16974a2463fa632f60a9a8f94d85d7a3c.jpg)  

The Author document property automatically provides the document author’s name  


# Tip  

If you want to insert a date and time field in a header or footer, you can also open the Date And Time dialog box from the Design tool tab. For more information about headers and footers, see “Insert headers, footers, and page numbers” in Chapter 9, “Format document elements.”  

3. In the Available formats list, select the date and time format you want.  

4. If you want to insert the date and time as a field (rather than static text), select the Update automatically check box. The field will update each time you open the document.  

5. Select OK.  

To edit a date and time field so it is updated when the file is saved  

1. Right-click the date and time field, and then select Edit Field to open the Field dialog box and display the properties and options for the current field.   
2. In the Categories list, select Date and Time to filter the Field names list to display only the fields that relate to dates and times.   
3. In the Field names list, select SaveDate.   
4. In the Date formats list, select the format you want.   
5. Select the Preserve formatting during updates check box.   
6. Select OK.  

To manually update a date and time field  

 Select the field, and then select the Update button that appears above it.   
Right-click the field and select Update Field.  

The field will update to the current date and time, to the date and time it was last saved, or to the date and time it was last printed, depending on the setting of the field.  

To lock a selected date and time field  

Press $\mathbf{Ctrl{+}F_{11}}$ .  

# Tip  

To unlock the field, select it, and then press Ctrl+Shift+F11.

![](images/674450af12f3342f9b566506dafc5cf0b07087b66fcb38634d3c1d3b64b6885d.jpg)  

You can insert document property fields into your document  

# INSERT AND MODIFY FOOTNOTES AND ENDNOTES  

When you want to make a comment about a statement in a document—for example, to explain an assumption or cite the source for a different opinion—you can enter the comment as a footnote or an endnote. Doing so inserts a number or symbol called a reference mark in the body of your document. The associated comment appears with the same number or symbol, either as a footnote at the bottom of the page or as an endnote at the end of the document or document section. In most views, footnotes or endnotes are divided from the main text by a horizontal note separator line.  

You can insert and manage footnotes and endnotes by using the commands in the Footnotes group on the References tab.  

![](images/30399f23fa812f7ab659a6b17b4b5fc1af57612fc2e3f39ed635c0f06fbc3bb8.jpg)  

Footnotes appear on the same page as their reference marks, and endnotes appear at the end of the document  

# Tip  

You can quickly display the actual footnotes or endnotes (rather than their reference marks) by selecting the Show Notes button.  

You can use commands in the Footnote And Endnote dialog box to change various settings, such as where the footnote or endnote should appear, how it should be laid out, and what number format to use. By default, footnote reference marks use the 1, 2, 3 number format, and endnote reference marks use the i, ii, iii number format.  

# To insert a footnote  

1. Click in the document where you want the footnote reference mark to appear.   
2. On the References tab, in the Footnotes group, select Insert Footnote.   
3. Word creates a blank footnote at the bottom of the page and displays a blinking cursor. Enter the footnote text, and then click anywhere outside of the footnote area to return to the document.  

To insert an endnote  

1. Click in the document where you want the endnote reference mark to appear.   
2. On the References tab, in the Footnotes group, select Insert Endnote.   
3. Word creates a blank endnote at the end of the document and displays a blinking cursor. Enter the endnote text, and then click anywhere outside of the endnote area to return to the document.  

To convert a footnote to an endnote  

Right-click the footnote, and then select Convert to Endnote.  

To convert an endnote to a footnote  

Right-click the endnote, and then select Convert to Footnote.  

To move among footnote or endnote references  On the References tab, in the Footnotes group, select the Next Footnote button. In the Footnotes group, in the Next Footnote list, select Next Footnote, Previous Footnote, Next Endnote, or Previous Endnote.  

# To display footnotes or endnotes  

 Double-click a reference mark in the body of the document to display its corresponding footnote or endnote. On the References tab, in the Footnotes group, select the Show Notes button to display the list of footnotes or endnotes.  

To change the number format of footnotes or endnotes  

1. On the References tab, select the Footnotes dialog box launcher to open th Footnote And Endnote dialog box.   
2. In the Location area of the Footnote and Endnote dialog box, select Footnotes or Endnotes to indicate the element you want to modify.   
3. In the Format area, in the Number format list, select the number format you want to use.   
4. Select Apply.  

To delete a footnote or endnote  

In the document text, select the footnote or endnote marker, and then press Delete.  

# CREATE AND MODIFY TABLES OF CONTENTS  

When you create a long document that includes headings, such as an annual report or a catalog with several sections, you might want to add a table of contents to the beginning of the document to give your readers an overview of the document content and help them navigate to specific sections. In a document that will be printed, you can indicate with a page number the page where each heading is located. If the document will be distributed electronically, you can link each entry in the table of contents to the corresponding heading in the document so readers can jump directly to the heading with a click of the mouse.  

# Office Procedures

# The table of contents is a field that can be updated  

By default, Word creates a table of contents based on the document headings (as indicated by the styles Heading 1, Heading 2, and so on). Word can also create a table of contents based on outline levels or on fields you insert in the document. When you tell Word to create a table of contents, Word identifies the entries and inserts the table at the cursor as a single field.  

For information about applying styles, see “Apply built-in styles to text” in Chapter 4, “Modify the structure and appearance of text.”  

The Table Of Contents controls are available from the References tab. In the Table Of Contents gallery, you can select from three standard options:  

 Automatic Table 1 This option inserts the heading Contents and a table of contents that references all Heading 1, Heading 2, and Heading 3 paragraphs.   
Automatic Table 2 This option inserts the heading Table of Contents and a table of contents that references all Heading 1, Heading 2, and Heading 3 paragraphs. Manual Table This option inserts the heading Table of Contents and a table of contents that contains placeholders that don’t reference any specific document content.  

![](images/b9ffbc95be7608899b97688101c3d2e31d25a69b4352f8f79fdf1a011a0dc8a8.jpg)  

You can choose from three main options in the Table Of Contents gallery  

Entries in a table of contents are formatted by using nine levels of built-in TOC styles (TOC 1, TOC 2, and so on). By default, Word uses the styles assigned in the template attached to the document. If you want to use a different style, you can create a custom table from the Table Of Contents dialog box. Here, you can choose from several formats, including Classic, Distinctive, Fancy, Modern, Formal, and Simple. (The Print Preview and Web Preview panes display a preview of the selected format.) You can also apply a different leader—that is, the set of characters used between the text and the corresponding page number in the table of contents. After you create a table of contents, you can format it manually by selecting text and then applying character or paragraph formatting or styles. (However, if you regenerate the table, the manual formatting will be replaced, so do this only after the table is final.)  

![](images/4a742928e8534f202e8bd9f623c38765e68031a1d5ceb92743e01224943720da.jpg)  
You can choose a different set of formatting styles for your table of contents  

# Tip  

The TOC styles are based on the Body font of the document theme. Each style has specific indent and spacing settings. If you create a table of contents based on the document template, you can customize the TOC styles during the creation process. To do so, select From Template in the Formats list. Then select the Modify button. The Style dialog box opens, displaying the nine TOC styles. You can modify the font, paragraph, tabs, border, and other formatting of these styles the same way you would modify any other style. For information about creating styles, see “Create and modify styles” in Chapter 15, “Create custom document elements.”  

You can modify the elements on which Word bases the table at any time, and update the table with a single click to reflect your changes. If you change a heading in the document or if edits to the text change the page breaks, you can update the table of contents to reflect those changes. You have the option of updating only the page numbers or, if you have changed, added, or deleted headings, you can update (recreate) the entire table.  

![](images/6d2fd813554bc9d5ad017a2231ccabc83ff7dc2e2dd8e873d326d139b8d5fb47.jpg)  

If headings or page breaks change, you can easily update the table of contents  

You can use the table of contents to navigate within your document. For example, you can hold down the Ctrl key and click on a heading in a table of contents to access the corresponding section in the text.  

![](images/b00a98a44470ca75df1c295eec80764158c33c59fdfba2b2b9ea8cc94dd0be1a.jpg)  

Hyperlink navigation functionality is built in to the table of contents  

# Tables of Figures  

If a document includes figures, tables, or equations, you can easily create a table of figures so readers can locate and quickly navigate to them. A table of figures is built from the tools in the Captions group on the References tab of the ribbon. You must insert a caption for each figure, table, or equation you want to include, and then generate the table.  

# Tables of Authorities  

If a legal document contains items such as regulations, cases, and statutes identified as legal citations, you can tell Word to create a table of authorities. In the table, citations are categorized as cases, statutes, rules, treatises, regulations, constitutional provisions, or other authorities.  

Word uses the citations to create this type of table the same way it uses headings to create a table of contents and captions to create a table of figures. You must insert a citation for each legal reference you want to include, and then generate the table.  

# To insert a table of contents for a document with headings  

1. Position the cursor in the document where you want to insert the table of contents.   
2. On the References tab, in the Table of Contents group, select the Table of Contentsbutton to display the Table of Contents menu.   
3. In the Table of Contents gallery, select the table of contents style you want.  

To create a custom table of contents  

1. Position the cursor in the document where you want to add a custom table of contents.  

2. On the References tab, in the Table of Contents group, select the Table of Contentsbutton, and then select Custom Table of Contents to open the Table Of Contents dialog box.  

3. In the General area of the Table of Contents tab, do the following:  

1. In the Formats list, select the style set you want to apply to the TOC elements.  

2. If you want to change the formatting, select Modify, redefine the formatting of each TOC level you want to change, and then select OK.  

3. In the Show levels list, select the number of outline levels you want the TOC to include.  

4. If you want to include only specific styles in the TOC, select Options, select the styles you want and clear the selection of the styles you don’t want, and then select OK.  

The Print Preview and Web Preview panes reflect your changes.  

4. In the Print Preview area of the tab, do the following:  

0. If you want to exclude page numbers from the TOC, clear the Show page numberscheck box.   
1. If you want to display the page numbers immediately after the TOC entries, clear the Right align page numbers check box.   
2. In the Tab leader list, select the leader option you want.   
5. Select OK.  

# To update a table of contents  

1. Do either of the following to display the Update Table Of Contents dialog box:  

1. Click anywhere in the table of contents to select it, and then select the Update button that appears above the table.  

# Tip  

The table of contents is contained in one large field. When you select it, you select the entire field. If you accidentally delete the table of contents, you can select the Undo button or press $\mathrm{Ctrl}{+}Z$ to bring it back. For information about fields, see “Display document information in fields” earlier in this chapter.  

2. On the References tab, in the Table of Contents group, select the Update Tablebutton.  

2. In the dialog box, do either of the following:   
0. Select Update page numbers only to update the page numbers but not the   
headings.   
1. Select Update entire table to update the headings and page numbers.   
3. Select OK.  

To jump to a location in the document from the table of contents  

1. Point to any entry in the table of contents.   
2. Press and hold the Ctrl key. The pointer changes to a hand.   
3. Select the entry to move directly to that heading.  


# To delete a table of contents  

1. On the References tab, in the Table of Contents group, select the Table of Contentsbutton.   
2. Select Remove Table of Contents.  

# CREATE AND MODIFY INDEXES  

To help readers find specific concepts and terms they might not be able to readily locate by looking at a table of contents, you can include an index at the end of a document. Word creates an index by compiling an alphabetical listing with page numbers based on index entry fields you mark in the document. As with a table of contents, an index is inserted as a single field.  

# Tip  

You don’t need to create indexes for documents that will be distributed electronically, because readers can use the Navigation pane to find the information they need. For more information, see “Find and replace text” in Chapter 3, “Enter and edit text.”  

<html><body><table><tr><td>animals</td><td>leasing.....</td></tr><tr><td>pets. 1,2</td><td>maintenance</td></tr><tr><td>wild. 1</td><td>buildings.....</td></tr><tr><td>BellevueFireDepartment 2</td><td>commonareas.</td></tr><tr><td>bicycles... 2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>birds... 1</td><td>emergency.... 8</td></tr><tr><td>boats 2</td><td>expenses... 8</td></tr><tr><td>cats.. .1,2</td><td>non-emergency 2,4</td></tr><tr><td>complaints 9</td><td>parking... 1,2</td></tr><tr><td>definitions..</td><td>pets...</td></tr><tr><td>1,2</td><td>recycling bins 2,3</td></tr><tr><td>dogs... 5,7</td><td>renting..... 6</td></tr><tr><td>doors</td><td>rollerskates.</td></tr><tr><td>dues 8</td><td>scooters....</td></tr><tr><td>monthly... specialassessments</td><td>storage...</td></tr><tr><td>garbage... 2</td><td>trailers....</td></tr><tr><td>5,6</td><td>tricycles. 2</td></tr><tr><td>landscaping</td><td>vans. 2.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# You can generate an index for your document to help readers find important topics  

In the index, an entry might apply to a word or phrase that appears on one page or that is discussed on several pages. The entry might have related subentries. For example, in the index to this book, the main index entry text effects might have below it the subentries applying and live preview of. An index might also include crossreference entries that direct readers to related entries. For example, the main index entry text wrapping breaks might be cross-referenced to line breaks. You can use cross references to direct readers to index terms they might not think of when looking for specific information.  

# Tip  

When building an index, bear in mind the terms readers are likely to look up. For example, one reader might expect to find information about cell phones by looking under cell, whereas another might look under mobile, another under phones, and another under telephones. A good index will include all four entries.  

Before you can generate an index for your document, you must insert index entry fields throughout the document. Word then compiles the entries in these fields into the index. To insert an index entry field into the document, you use the Mark Index Entry dialog box. In this dialog box, you can do the following:  

 Modify the selected text to alter how it appears in the index.   
 Add a subentry. Designate the entry as a cross-reference, one-page entry, or, if the selected text spans multiple pages, a page-range entry. In the case of page-range entries, Word creates a bookmark for the selected text and prompts you to enter a name for it in the Mark Index Entry dialog box.   
 Format the page number associated with the entry—for example, to make it appear bold or italic in the index.  

![](images/5a166222e58c6455d73b23d99796c5310984443b3eeac49642bc1ce0e5435d31.jpg)  

You can edit, add a subentry to, and otherwise adjust the index entry in this dialog box  

After you set the options in the dialog box, you can insert an index entry field adjacent to the selected text by selecting Mark, or adjacent to every occurrence of the selected text in the document by selecting Mark All.  

The Mark Index Entry dialog box remains open to simplify the process of inserting multiple index entry fields, so you don’t have to select the Mark Entry button for each new entry. You can move the dialog box off to the side so it doesn’t block the text you’re working with.  

Index entry fields are formatted as hidden. They are not visible unless you display formatting marks and hidden characters. When the index entry field is visible, the entry appears in the document enclosed in quotation marks within a set of braces, with the designator $X E$ and a dotted underline.  

To compile an index based on the index entries in a document, you work in the Index dialog box.  

![](images/e0c5b4e9a696cdec62ec2025ba6b02c13ae7c1ddb9416fb3513a9f0ed92b6a9d.jpg)  

You use the Index dialog box to set up the index  

In this dialog box, you can specify the following:  

Whether the index formatting should use styles from the current template or be based on one of four predefined formats, which you can preview in the Print Preview box Whether page numbers should be right-aligned, and if so, whether they should have dotted, dashed, or solid tab leaders Whether the index should be indented, with each subentry on a separate line below its main entry, or run-in, with subentries on the same line as the main entries  The number of columns you want  

When you select OK in the Index dialog box, Word calculates the page numbers of all the entries and subentries, consolidates them, and inserts the index as one field in the specified format at the specified location in the document.  

You can edit the text of the index generated from the entries, but the changes you make are not permanent. If you regenerate the index, the original entries will be restored. It is more efficient to edit the text within the quotation marks in the index entry fields. You can move and copy index entries by using the same techniques you would for regular text. If you make changes to a document that affect index entries or page numbering, you can update the index.  

# To mark a word or short phrase as an index entry  

1. Select the word or phrase you want to mark. Then do any of the following to open or activate the Mark Index Entry dialog box:  

1. On the References tab, in the Index group, select the Mark   
Entry button.   
2. Press Alt $^{\cdot+}$ Shift $\mathbf{\sigma}_{+\mathbf{X}}$ .   
3. If the Mark Index Entry dialog box is already open, select its title bar.  

Notice that the selected word or phrase has already been entered in the Main Entry box.  

2. If you want, select the text and enter text—for example, making a word plural or lowercase.  

# Tip  

Index entries appear in the index exactly as they appear in the Mark Index Entry dialog box. For consistency, make all nouns (except proper nouns) plural and lowercase, and all verbs gerund (ending in “ing”).  

3. Do either of the following:  

0. Select Mark to insert an index entry field next to just this occurrence of the selected word or phrase.   
1. Select Mark All to insert index entry fields adjacent to every occurrence of the selected word or phrase in the document.  

# Tip  

Index entries are case sensitive. If you mark an entry that is lowercase, any uppercase instances of the word or phrase will not be indexed, because their capitalization does not match the selected word. The Mark Index Entry dialog box remains open even after you insert the index entry, so you can quickly add more index entries. When you’re finished marking index entries, simply close the dialog box.  

To mark text that is longer than one page as an index entry  

1. Select the text segment you want to mark.   
2. Open the Mark Index Entry dialog box or, if it is already open, select its title bar to activate it.   
3. The selected text appears in the Main Entry box. Replace the text segment with an appropriate index entry.   
4. Select Page range.   
5. In the Bookmark field, enter a bookmark name for the selected text.  

# Tip  

Bookmark names can contain only numbers, letters, and underscore characters. To name bookmarks with multiple words, either run the words together and capitalize each word or replace the spaces with underscores for readability.  

6. Select the Mark button.  

To add a cross-reference to an index entry  

1. After marking a word, phrase, or longer text as an index entry, without leaving the Mark Index Entry dialog box, in the Options area, select the Crossreference option. Notice that the cursor moves to the space after the word See in the adjacent box.   
2. Without moving the cursor, enter the text you want to use for a crossreference. This text should exactly match another index entry in the document.   
3. Select Mark to insert a cross-reference to the new index entry adjacent to the current index entry.  

To enter a subentry for an index entry  

1. Select the word or phrase you want to mark.   
2. Open the Mark Index Entry dialog box or, if it is already open, select its title bar to activate it.   
3. In the Subentry box, enter the subentry.   
4. Select Mark to insert an index entry with the entry and subentry separated by a colon.  

To edit an index entry  

Click within the index entry in the document (not in the Mark Index Entry dialog box) and then make the changes you want.  

To insert an index in a document  

1. In a document with previously marked index entries, position the cursor where you want to insert the index—usually at the end of the document.   
2. On the Home tab, in the Paragraph group, select the Show/Hide $^\mathparagraph$ button to hide formatting marks, fields, and content formatted as hidden.  


# Tip  

Dragging through any part of an index entry field that includes one of the enclosing braces selects the entire field. If you find it hard to select only the entry, try pointing to the right of the closing brace $(\nmid)$ and dragging slightly to the left.  

# To update an index  

Click anywhere in the index, and then, on the References tab, in the Index group, select the Update Index button. Right-click the index and then select Update Field.  

# CITE SOURCES AND COMPILE BIBLIOGRAPHIES  

Many types of documents you create might require bibliographies that list the sources of the information in or referenced in the documents. Whether your sources are books, periodicals, websites, or interviews, you can record details about them. You can also select a common style guide, such as The Chicago Manual of Style, to have Word automatically list your sources in that style guide’s standard format.  

# Bibliography

A bibliography formatted to meet the specifications of The Chicago Manual of Style, Sixteenth Edition  

Word offers a tool, called the Source Manager, to help you keep track of sources and to ensure that you reference them in the proper format. When you enter source information, Word stores the information in a separate file on your computer’s hard drive so you can cite the sources in any document you create. The Source Manager offers easy access to this master list of sources, in addition to access to the list of sources cited in your current document.  

![](images/96f4092dc1bb7199f464b322e7716b44fe1060a58282e1c7ae30364ee33565e1.jpg)  

The Source Manager accumulates sources from all documents, so if other documents already contain citations, their source information might appear here  

# Tip  

To add a source in the master list to the current document, select it in the Master List box in the Source Manager dialog box and then select Copy to copy it to the Current List box.  

To create sources, you use the Create Source dialog box. In this dialog box, you can select the type of source—for example, whether it’s a book, a journal article, or other type of source. You can then enter the author of the source, the title of the source, and other key information. If the source has multiple authors, you can open the Edit Name dialog box to enter them all.  

![](images/24678f75a9fd34c9998d7814e0df20b7b094b7326217fc451d8b0c1108d94e16.jpg)  
Record information about content sources for your bibliography  

Within your document, you can cite the sources you create by using the Source Manager dialog box or by using the Insert Citation menu available from the Citations & Bibliography group of the References tab. You can also use the Insert Citation menu to create new citations as you work and to set placeholders for citations, which you can fill in later. When you add a citation to the document, it appears alongside the associated text in the format you specified—for example, The Chicago Manual of Style.  

Moreand more,peopleareseeingthevalueandbeautyofusingbamboo in theirhomestoachievemodern-dayfashionwithanethnicflavor.Entire books have been written on the subject (American BambooSociety 2018), including Big Bad Bamboo and Bamboo, Family Style.  

This document includes a citation  

If you know you need to insert a citation, but you don’t have all the information about your source handy, you can insert a placeholder. Then, when you gather the information you need, you can update the placeholder.  

After you enter citations in a document, you can compile their sources into a list with one of three headings: Bibliography, References, or Works Cited. (The heading you choose is usually specified by the organization or person for whom you are preparing the document, such as your company, your instructor, or the publication in which you intend to publish the document.) You can also insert a source list without a heading.

When you compile a bibliography, Word inserts it at the cursor as one field. You can edit the text of a bibliography, but if the source information changes, it is more efficient to edit the source in the Source Manager and then update the bibliography the same way you would update a table of contents or index.

# KEY POINTS  

Bookmarking information makes it easy to locate or reference the information later. You can display document information such as the title and author in automatically updating fields within the document. You can provide peripheral or supporting information in footnotes at the bottom of each page or endnotes at the end of the document. A table of contents provides an overview of the topics covered in a document and helps readers navigate quickly to a topic heading. After marking index entries for key concepts, words, and phrases, you can compile an index to the document’s content. Word can keep track of information sources and compile a bibliography of cited sources that meets the requirements of a specific writing style guide.

# UNDERSTAND THE MAIL MERGE PROCESS  

The process for creating a mail merge document is straightforward and logical. All the tools for performing mail merge operations are available from the Mailings tab. From this tab, you can run the wizard or perform individual steps of the mail merge process on your own.  

![](images/d94138462eb109b9d2d5a8f46dc36e710508c130bc662c006a7a2767045ed5f8.jpg)  

# Mail merge tools are located on the Mailings tab  

Three important terms used when discussing mail merge processes include:  

Data source The file or storage entity that contains the variable information you want to pull into the merge output.  

Field A specific category of information, such as a first name, last name, birthdate, customer number, item number, or price.   
Record A set of the information that goes in the fields—for example, information about a specific person or transaction. A record doesn’t have to contain information for every field, but it must have a placeholder for any missing information.  

The mail merge process varies slightly depending on whether you’re creating one document per record or one document containing all the records. However, the basic process is this:  

1. Identify a data source that contains the records you want to use.   
2. Create a document into which you want to merge the records.   
3. In the document, identify the fields from the data source that you want to merge into the document.   
4. Preview the results and make any necessary adjustments.   
5. Merge the data into the document to either create one or more new document or to print the merge results directly to the printer.  

You can perform the mail merge process by using the commands on the Mailings tab of the ribbon, or you can get step-by-step guidance from the Mail Merge wizard. The wizard displays options in a series of panes, and you choose the options you want. If you’re new to mail merge, the wizard can provide a helpful framework. If you are comfortable with the mail merge process and know what you want to create, it can be faster to perform the steps manually.  

# To use the Mail Merge wizard  

1. Start Word and display the Mailings tab.   
2. In the Start Mail Merge group, select Start Mail Merge, and then select Step-by-Step Mail Merge Wizard.   
3. In each of the six panes of the wizard, select an option or provide the requested information.   
4. In the last pane, specify whether to send the merge output directly to the printer or to create one or more documents that you can review and save.  

# START THE MAIL MERGE PROCESS  

For most mail merge projects, you need a starting document that provides structure and common content, and that identifies the locations where you want to insert data. You specify the data to merge into each location by inserting merge fields. The merge fields pull data from the data source fields into the starting document. To identify the data fields available for the mail merge operation, you must select the data source and import its records into the Mail Merge Recipients list.  

The best starting point varies based on the type of output that you want to create. The output categories include letters, email messages, envelopes, labels, and directories.  

In this topic, we discuss ways of getting started with a mail merge process based on the output type.  

If you find that you need help, you can start the wizard from any point in the process and move back to make changes or forward to keep the work you’ve done.  

# Get started with letters  

If you’re creating a form letter or similar document, you can write the document, connect to the data source, and then insert the merge fields, or you can start with a blank document, connect to the data source, and then insert the merge fields as you write the document. Either way, you can’t insert merge fields in a document until you connect to the data source.  

If you’re creating a document that needs to go through a review process, it’s easier to do that before you connect to the data source; otherwise, the document tries to connect to the data source each time a reviewer opens it. When that’s the case, you can insert placeholders in the document where you plan to insert merge fields later. You can set off the placeholders from the real text by using brackets or highlighting to indicate to reviewers that the placeholders aren’t final content, and to make them easy to locate later.  

![](images/61cb63b6f02c3824e21bab4906698bcd2be531dc44b7da0572860e1257ad433a.jpg)  

It’s easiest to write and edit your document before starting the mail merge process  

If you need help creating a document for your intended purpose, you can use any of the Word content templates. A wide variety of templates is available from the New page of the Backstage view.  

To start a letter mail merge  

1. Open a blank document or a document that contains the static content you want to pull data into.   
2. On the Mailings tab, in the Start Mail Merge group, select Start Mail Merge.   
3. On the Start Mail Merge menu, select Letters. There is no visible change to the document.   
4. To continue and complete the process:  

1. Use the procedures described in “Choose and refine the data source” later in this chapter to identify the data source and available fields.  

2. Create or edit the document content, and use the procedures described in “Insert merge fields” later in this chapter to insert the merge fields.  

3. Use the procedures described in “Preview and complete the merge” later in this chapter to finish creating the letter.  

# Get started with labels  

The mail merge processes for labels are designed not only for stickers but also for name tags, badge inserts, business cards, tab inserts for page dividers, CD labels, postcards, notecards, printable magnets, and anything else that you print onto paper or other sheet-fed media that is divided into fixed areas. Many of these products are available from office supply and craft supply retailers. Common manufacturers of label materials include Avery and 3M, but there are many others.  

![](images/be241426645854517e573c63dcc030046554f97d11aa044aff7cc73688f6a79b.jpg)  


# To start a label mail merge  

1. Open a blank document and display paragraph marks and formatting symbols. 2. On the Mailings tab, in the Start Mail Merge group, select Start Mail Merge.  

3. On the Start Mail Merge menu, select Labels. The Label Options dialog box opens.  

![](images/7220a4cd8cd3eef341819c6ddb47f5cd66ba0cea7a2c5be7952f06e0b4f7b734.jpg)  

Thousands of label products are available from this dialog box  

4. In the Printer information area, choose the correct printer type for the label forms and, for standard printers, choose the input tray (or manual feed) for the label sheets.  

5. On the label package, identify the manufacturer and product number of the labels you will use. In the Label information area, do the following:  

1. In the Label vendors list, select the label manufacturer.   
2. In the Product number list, select the product number.  

# Tip  

To save time, select in the Product Number box and then press the keyboard key corresponding to the first character of the product number to jump to that section of the list. Then scroll to locate the specific product number. If the label product you’re using doesn’t already appear in the list, select the Find Updates On Office.Com link to refresh the list.  

6. In the Label Options dialog box, select OK to return to the document. Word creates the label form in which you will enter the merge fields and any static content.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="4"></td></tr><tr><td>女</td><td>女</td><td>1 女</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td></td><td>1 女</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>女</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>1 女</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

Ensure that paragraph symbols and formatting marks are shown before continuing  

7. To continue and complete the process:  

0. Use the procedures described in “Choose and refine the data source” later in this chapter to identify the data source and available fields.  

1. Create or edit the static label content, and use the procedures described in “Insert merge fields” later in this chapter to insert the merge fields.  

2. Use the procedures described in “Preview and complete the merge” later in this chapter to finish creating the labels.  

# Get started with email messages  

When you want to send the same information to all the people on a list—for example, all your customers, or all the members of a club or your family—you don’t have to print letters and physically mail them. Instead, you can use mail merge to create a personalized email message for each person in a data source. As with a form letter that will be printed, you can either use the Mail Merge wizard or use the buttons on the Mailings tab to insert merge fields into a document. These merge fields will be replaced with information from the specified data source, and the starting document will be converted to individual email messages.  

Many email messages need no merge fields other than a greeting line.  

《GreetingLine》

If you want to edit the custom greeting, right-click the merge field and then select Edit Greeting Line  

# https://avxhm.se/blogs/hill0  

Because email messages tend to be less formal than printed letters, you might want to start the messages with a custom greeting rather than one of the predefined greeting options (Dear and To).  

# To start an email mail merge  

1. Open a blank document or a document that contains the static content you want to pull data into.   
2. On the Mailings tab, in the Start Mail Merge group, select Start Mail Merge.   
3. On the Start Mail Merge menu, select E-mail Messages. Word displays the current content in Web view.  


# CHOOSE AND REFINE THE DATA SOURCE  

The mail merge process combines variable information from a data source with static information in a starting document. The basic data source requirement is the same regardless of the output format: it must be a container that stores information in a consistent structure.  

![](images/d17a231096aaf5994da966e9906258f7195797ccab655ae2a199dd0f6597265b.jpg)  

Most data source structures store data in a tabular format, with fields identified at the top and records following. The most straightforward example of this, and the one we work with throughout this chapter, is a Microsoft Excel workbook.  

Each field in a data source must be identified by a unique name so you can pull data from the field into the starting document. In Excel, the field names are the table headers or column headers.  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>A</td><td colspan="2">B</td><td colspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">D E</td><td colspan="2">F</td><td colspan="2" rowspan="5">？</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>FirstName</td><td>LastName</td><td>Address</td><td></td><td>City</td><td>State</td><td>PostalCode</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Patrick</td><td>Wedge</td><td>151FirDrive</td><td></td><td>Bangor</td><td>AK</td><td>10136</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Pia</td><td>Westermann</td><td colspan="2">221 Mahogany Dr</td><td>San Antonio</td><td>ND</td><td>10218</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Greg</td><td>Yvkoff</td><td colspan="2">791Beech Terrace</td><td>Toledo</td><td>MT</td><td>10367</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Lee</td><td>Chia</td><td colspan="2">79Beech Rd</td><td>Houston</td><td>ND</td><td>10537</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Joseph</td><td>Matthews</td><td colspan="2">895Gum Bay</td><td>Evansville</td><td>OK</td><td>10826</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>James</td><td colspan="2">Van Eaton</td><td>742MadroneSt</td><td>Rockford</td><td>IN</td><td>11374</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Humberto</td><td colspan="2">Acevedo 421Hawthorn Ct</td><td>Tucson</td><td></td><td>MA</td><td>11491</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Anette</td><td>Grohsmull</td><td colspan="7">Mail MergeRecipients</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>David</td><td>Hodgson</td><td colspan="7">Thisisthelistof recipients thatwill beused inyourmerge.Use theoptionsbelowto addto orchangeyour list.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Jim</td><td>Wickham</td><td colspan="7">Usethecheckboxestoaddorremoverecipientsfrom themerge.Whenyourlistisready,click OK.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Paulo</td><td>Lisboa</td><td>Data Source</td><td></td><td>LastName</td><td>FirstName</td><td>Address</td><td>City</td><td></td><td>Sta</td></tr><tr><td>13 14</td><td>Ty</td><td>Carlson</td><td>CustomerList.xlsx</td><td>√</td><td>Wedge</td><td>Patrick</td><td>151FirDrive</td><td></td><td>Bangor</td><td>AK ND</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Amy</td><td>Recker</td><td>CustomerList.xlsx</td><td></td><td>Westermann</td><td>Pia</td><td>221Mahogany Dr</td><td></td><td>San Antonio</td><td>MT</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Jane</td><td>Clayton</td><td>CustomerList.xlsx</td><td></td><td>Yvkoff</td><td>Greg</td><td></td><td>791BeechTerrace</td><td>Toledo</td><td>ND</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Kevin</td><td>Liu</td><td>CustomerList.xlsx</td><td></td><td>Chia</td><td>Lee</td><td>79BeechRd</td><td></td><td>Houston</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>George</td><td>Jiang</td><td>CustomerList.xlsx</td><td></td><td>Matthews</td><td>Joseph</td><td>895Gum Bay</td><td></td><td>Evansville</td><td>OK</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Paula</td><td>Nartker</td><td>CustomerList.xlsx</td><td></td><td>Van Eaton</td><td>James</td><td></td><td>742Madrone St</td><td>Rockford</td><td>IN</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Customers</td><td>CustomerList.xlsx</td><td></td><td>Acevedo</td><td>Humberto</td><td></td><td>421Hawthorn Ct</td><td>Tucson</td><td>MA AL</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td></td><td>CustomerList.xlsx</td><td></td><td>Grohsmuller</td><td>Anette</td><td></td><td>956Cypress Ln</td><td>Denver</td><td>WY</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"></td><td>CustomerList.xlsx</td><td></td><td>Hodgson</td><td>David</td><td></td><td>292Maple Terrace</td><td>Youngstown</td><td>></td></tr></table></body></html>  

# Select an existing data source  

The full list of acceptable data source file types is lengthy. Typical data sources include Excel worksheets and delimited text files, but you can also pull data from tables in Microsoft Word, Access, or SQL Server; from a Microsoft Outlook contact list; or from a variety of other, less common sources.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>AllFiles(*.*)</td></tr><tr><td>All Data Sources（*.odc;*.mdb;*.mde;*accdb;*.accde;*.ols;*.udl;*.dsn;*xlsx;*xlsm;..

All the file types that are accepted as data sources  

# Tip  

If your company or organization uses another contact-management system, you can probably export information to one of these formats. Delimited text files are the most basic format of structured information storage and should be an export option from any other information storage system.  

The data source doesn’t have to be stored on your computer; the wizard can link to remotely stored data. If the data source is stored on a server that requires you to log on, you can provide your credentials and, optionally, store your password.  

# Tip  

It isn’t necessary for the data source file to be closed during the import operation; you can import records from an open file, edit and save the file, and refresh the list with the changes.  

If you use Outlook to manage your Microsoft Exchange or Exchange Online email, contacts, and calendar information, you can import data from an Exchange account contact folder to use as a mail merge data source. The Mail Merge wizard polls your Outlook data folders and provides a list of contact folders that you can use. When you choose a contact folder, the wizard imports the contact list.  

It’s likely that your contact list contains a variety of contacts—clients, employees, friends, relatives, and other people you have corresponded with. Many of these contacts might not be current, and many of them might not be people to whom you want to direct the specific form letter or email message that you’re creating. But that’s okay; you can import the entire contact list and then use the filtering function in the Mail Merge Recipients dialog box to identify only those people you want to include in your current mail merge project.  

Mail MergeRecipients  

![](images/e959cd2be13970cf1584c2b258494179b57a0fbfb10e56475774144a4a425f09.jpg)  

A selected check box indicates that a record will be included in the mail merge  


# Create a new data source  

If the information that you want to include in your data source isn’t already stored in a file or address list, you can create a Microsoft Office Address List while working in the Mail Merge wizard. The wizard saves your list as a table in an Access database (.mdb) file in the My Data Sources subfolder of your Documents folder.  

The process of entering information through the Address List interface is somewhat tedious, because you must manually populate each field—so if you have a lot of records, it’s easier to enter your data into an Excel worksheet. However, it’s fine for an impromptu mail merge process, such as creating a set of name tags for a meeting.  

![](images/428b9d57f7a39bad77780d1bfa185b8c4a315691966c30207f85314c0794dedd.jpg)  
Creating a simple list in the wizard  

You’re not limited to collecting contact information; you can add, remove, and reorder the fields to store the type of data that is pertinent to your mail merge process.  

# To create a data source from the Mailings tab  

1. On the Mailings tab, in the Start Mail Merge group, select Select Recipients, and then select Type a New List. 2. In the New Address List dialog box, do the following:   
1. Select Customize Columns. Add any fields to the column list that you plan   
to include in the mail merge operation. To keep things tidy, you can remove fields   
that you don’t plan to use.   
2. Enter the information for each record, selecting New Entry to create another. 3. When you finish, select OK. 4. In the Save Address List dialog box, provide a name for the database file, and then select Save.  

# Refine the data source records  

The data source you choose doesn’t have to be specific to the item you’re creating. For example, you could create postcards announcing an in-store sale only for customers who live in that area, or create gift certificates only for people who have birthdays in the next month.  

If you don’t want to include all the data source records in your mail merge operation, you can now whittle down the list to those you want. You can use the following processes to remove a record from the recipient list:  

Filter the list on one or more fields You can filter the list to display only the records that you want to include, or to locate (and then remove) the records that you want to exclude. Remove duplicates The wizard can help to identify entries that might be duplicates. You can either clear the check boxes for the duplicate versions that you don’t want to use, or you can remove the entries from the data source file, save the file, and refresh the recipients list.  Manually exclude records Each record has a check box. Clearing the check box removes the record from the mail merge operation.  

Excluding records from the mail merge operation does not remove them from the Mail Merge Recipients list or from the original data source file. They will still be available for you to use in this or another mail merge operation.  

In addition to limiting the set of information used in a mail merge, you can also sort the records to specify the order in which they appear in the mail merge document— for example, in postal code order for a bulk mailing.  



# INSERT MERGE FIELDS  

In the document, merge fields are enclosed in chevrons (« and »). However, you can’t simply type the chevrons and the field name; you must insert the merge field by using the commands on the Mailings tab. This creates a link from the merge field to the data source field.  

The commands that you use to insert merge fields in a starting document are in the Write & Insert Fields group on the Mailings tab.  

![](images/15e20b174c0b6e1129042befeae99deaa15cd1c8a24d66494aa2292d0283a4c3.jpg)  
The tools for inserting fields in mail merge documents  

Every field in the data source is available to insert as an individual merge field. Two additional merge fields that pull information from the data source are available to save you time:  

Address Block This merge field inserts elements of a standard address block (the recipient’s name, company name, and postal address) that you select so you can insert all the information with one merge field.  

![](images/0b7e7cc8b558be269fa47bd26ee448118ace737f93d0fb7711c960e60c515a8b.jpg)  
You can customize the Address Block merge field  

Greeting Line This merge field inserts a personalized salutation or substitutes a generic salutation for records that are missing the necessary information.  

![](images/5ad0412db9a5d0e6a564eed36bd8d5efdca483ad66bb5b8cac87f47897dbce6b.jpg)  
You can select from multiple greetings and name forms  

After you insert the first merge field in a document, the Highlight Merge Fields button in the Write & Insert Fields group on the Mailings tab becomes active. Select this button to highlight (in gray) all the merge fields in the document so they’re easier to locate.

Highlight the merge fields to more easily locate them and verify that they aren’t placeholders  


# PREVIEW AND COMPLETE THE MERGE  

After you specify the data source you want to use and enter merge fields in the main document, you can preview the effect of merging the records into the documents, and then perform the actual merge. You can further filter the source data during the preview process. When you’re ready, you can either send the merged documents directly to the printer or you can merge them into a new document. If you merge to a new document, you have another chance to review and, if necessary, edit the merged documents before sending them to the printer.  


# To preview merged documents  

1. Display the starting document with merge fields in place and the data source attached.   
2. On the Mailings tab, in the Preview Results group, select Preview Results to display the data source information in place of the merge fields.   
3. In the Preview Results group, do any of the following:  

1. Select the Next Record or Previous Record button to move through the data source one record at a time.  

2. Select the First Record or Last Record button to move to the first or last record in the data source.  

3. Select Preview Results again to redisplay the merge fields.  

To merge the data to a new document  

1. On the Mailings tab, in the Finish group, select Finish & Merge, and then Edit Individual Documents. The Merge To New Document dialog box opens.  

![](images/cba521d410410aa91e0681237250b94a7d8d332a739b8bb327228a50f70153f6.jpg)  

2. In the Merge to New Document dialog box, indicate the record or records that you want to merge, and then select OK.  

To merge the data and print the resulting file  

1. On the Mailings tab, in the Finish group, select Finish & Merge, and then Print Documents.   
2. In the Merge to Printer dialog box, indicate the record or records that you want to merge, and then select OK.   
3. In the Print dialog box, select your printer, configure any additional printer settings that are necessary, and then select OK.  

To merge the data and email the resulting messages  

1. On the Mailings tab, in the Finish group, select Finish & Merge, and then Send Email Messages. The Merge To E-mail dialog box opens.  

![](images/1457c061b892dd1f71537b5c0c84619d0c10fcbd92200e471d225f9dcd55e88f.jpg)  
You specify the address field and subject line before sending the messages  

2. In the Message options area, do the following:   
1. In the To list, select the field that contains the recipients’ email addresses.   
2. In the Subject line box, enter the message subject you want the email   
message to display.   
3. In the Mail format list, select Attachment, Plain text, or HTML. 3. In the Send records area, indicate the record or records that you want to merge. Then select OK.  

# CREATE INDIVIDUAL ENVELOPES AND LABELS  

If you want to print a lot of envelopes or mailing labels based on data source fields, you can use the mail merge function to create documents, and then print the documents onto envelopes or sheet-fed labels rather than regular paper.  

However, you can also use the Envelopes and Labels commands to create one or more individually addressed envelopes or address labels. Because these functions are related to “mailing” envelopes or packages, they are located on the Mailing tab of the ribbon with the mail merge functionality.  

# Generate individual envelopes  

The Envelope function prints a delivery address and can also print a return address and electronic postage, if you have the necessary software installed. You can manually enter the delivery address, or you can pick it up from a document (usually a letter) that contains an address.  

![](images/56504d8fe252f95abcb293806565478bea6a80c0d437cdedc3fd21dda58d3e00.jpg)  

You can edit the address information before creating or printing the envelope  

# Tip  

You can save time by storing the return address with your user information. The address then appears by default as the return address in the Envelopes And Labels dialog box.  

When creating envelopes, you can specify the envelope size, the address locations, and the fonts for the addresses. You can also specify the paper source, the envelope feed method (horizontally or vertically and face up or face down), and the alignment of the envelope. Then Word configures the page layout options and print options as required for your selections.  

![](images/596ba3b8b2944f282c397da3920db393d4cd667cc771e5577e105765ac9329bb.jpg)  
You can position the addresses on the envelope exactly where you want them  

When you create an envelope based on an address in a letter, you can print the envelope immediately, or add the envelope page to the document and then print the envelope and letter later.  

![](images/4894f6bdb18a4ad2626c144cf281f1ed500c56fd1ee36dd79e25e1e10f2d0281.jpg)  

Adding the envelope to the document inserts it as a separate document section with unique page layout settings  



# Generate individual mailing labels  

The Labels function is designed to print one address (a delivery address or a return address) onto a sheet of labels, to create either a single label or a full sheet of the same label. Instead of selecting an envelope size, you select a label form by first selecting the label manufacturer and then selecting the specific product number. Word sets up a document to precisely match the content layout areas of the selected form.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Samantha Smith 123PlumeriaCourt HibiscusHill,CA98765</td><td>Samantha Smith 123PlumeriaCourt Hibiscus Hill,CA 98765</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Samantha Smith 123PlumeriaCourt Hibiscus Hill, CA 98765</td><td></td><td>Samantha Smith 123PlumeriaCourt Hibiscus Hill, CA 98765</td></tr><tr><td>Samantha Smith 123PlumeriaCourt</td><td></td><td>Samantha Smith 123PlumeriaCourt</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# The content cells defined by the table match the printing areas of the label sheets  

As discussed in “Get started with labels” earlier in this chapter, the term “labels” refers not only to rectangular stickers, but also to many other things that you print onto sheet-fed media that is divided into fixed areas. You can use the Labels function to print on any of these. It’s important that you select the correct form because the print areas are very specifically defined.  

# To set up individual mailing labels  

1. Open any document.   
2. On the Mailings tab, in the Create group, select Labels to open the Envelopes And Labels dialog box.   
3. In the Address area, do either of the following: 1. If you’ve saved your return address information in Word and want to create a return address label, select the Use return address check box to insert the saved address into the Address box. Then review the return address information and modify it as necessary. 2. Enter the name and address that you want Word to print on the label.  

![](images/352017781b9aa7437706d1bb9da031babe124a456af87a85097e9425305c18df.jpg)  

Although the field specifies an address, you can print any text on the labels  

4. In the Print area, do either of the following to correctly configure the label output:   
0. If you want to print one full sheet of labels, select Full page of the same label.   
1. If you want to print only one label, select Single label and then enter the row and column of the position on the sheet of the label you want to print on.  

# Tip  

This feature permits you to easily reuse a partial sheet of blank labels.  

5. In the Label area, confirm that the label type is the correct one for the printed label forms you’re using. If it is not, configure the label settings in the Label Options dialog box.  


# KEY POINTS  

 The mail merge process is that of merging variable information from a data source into the static content of a main document such as a letter, envelope, sheet of labels, or email message. Mail merge data sources are organized into sets of information, called records, with each record containing the same items of information, called fields. You insert merge field placeholders into the main document to tell Word where to merge fields from the data source.   
You don’t have to use all the records from a data source for a mail merge; you can filter the data and exclude specific records.   
 The mail merge process can create a new document that you can edit or save, or you can send the results directly to your printer or to email recipients.  

![](images/86285c6a4280b1694f3f94d8e23361b7e9db7638a2f94640af011ab5783ec253.jpg)  


# Insert merge fields  

Open the InsertFields document, and then perform the following tasks:  

1. Start a letter mail merge. Select the PolicyholdersList workbook from the practice file folder as the data source, and select the PolicyHolders $\$1$ table of the workbook when prompted to do so.   
2. Replace each placeholder in the document with its corresponding merge field.   
3. Save the InsertFields document, but don’t close it.   
4. Create a new blank document and start a new letter mail merge. Use the same data source as in step 1.   
5. Open the Insert Address Block dialog box. Review the settings and make any changes you want, and then insert the merge field.   
6. In the document, two lines below the address block, insert a Greeting Line merge field.   
7. Save the document as MyFields, and then close it. Leave the InsertFields document open for the next set of practice tasks.  

Preview and complete the merge  

Complete the previous set of practice tasks to modify the InsertFields document. Then perform the following tasks:  

1. Use the tools in the Preview Results group on the Mailings tab to preview the results of completing the mail merge. Then redisplay the merge fields.   
2. Merge the data source into the document to create a new document. Save the document as MyLetter, and then close it.   
3. Redisplay the InsertFields document and follow the procedure to merge the output directly to the printer. (If you don’t want to print the file, select Cancel in the final dialog box.)   
4. Follow the procedure to merge the output to email messages. Explore the settings, and then select Cancel.   
5. Save and close the InsertFields document.  

Create individual envelopes and labels  

Open the CreateEnvelopes document, and then perform the following tasks:  

1. Open the Word Options dialog box and display the Advanced page. In the Generalsection, check whether you have saved your mailing address. If you have not, do so now. 2. Open the Envelopes and Labels dialog box. Verify that the Return Address box contains your saved mailing address. 3. In the Delivery address box, enter the name and address of another person. Then add the envelope to the document. 4. In the document, select the letter recipient’s name and address, and then open the Envelopes and Labels dialog box. Verify that the Return Address box contains your mailing address, and the Delivery Address box contains the letter recipient’s name and address. 5. In the Envelope Options dialog box, configure the envelope printing options and then, if you want, load an envelope into your printer, and print the addresses onto the envelope. 6. Save and close the CreateEnvelopes document. 7. Create a new blank document. 8. Display the Labels tab of the Envelopes and Labels dialog box. If your saved mailing address is not already shown in the Address box, select the Use return address check box to add your saved information to the Address box. 9. Configure the merge output to print one full sheet of labels. 10. Do either of the following: 1. If you have a sheet of labels to print to, configure the label settings. Then load a eet of labels into the printer and print the addresses onto the labels.  

2. If you don’t have a sheet of labels, generate a new document that contains the merged labels. Then save the document as MyLabels, and close it.  

# CREATE AND MODIFY STYLES  

Even if you don’t want to create your own templates, it’s very useful to know how to create and modify styles. When you apply direct character formatting or paragraph formatting, you affect only the selected characters or paragraphs. If you change your mind about how you want to format a particular element, you have to change the formatting manually everywhere it is applied. When you format characters or paragraphs by applying a style, you can change the way all of those characters or paragraphs look simply by changing the style definition. With one change in one place, you can completely change the look of the document.  

You can modify existing styles or create new styles. When you modify a style, document content with that style applied reflects your changes immediately. When you create or modify styles, you can choose to make them active in the current document only, or in all documents based on the template you’re working in.  

You can modify the content of the Styles gallery for the current template by adding and removing styles, so the styles you want are available from the gallery and the styles you rarely use don’t distract you.  

![](images/243acaa41b87807ab933fca600613f731f1afbe373605c5c2e39de4ce89461da.jpg)  

# A customized Styles gallery  

Adding and removing styles in the gallery doesn’t affect the styles in the Styles pane. If you create or modify styles and don’t want to save them as part of a template, you can save the style definitions as a custom style set.  

# To open the Modify Style dialog box  

In the Style gallery, right-click the style you want to modify, and then select Modify.   
In the Styles pane, point to the style you want to modify, select the arrow that appears to the right of the style name, and then select Modify.   
In the Apply Styles dialog box, select the style you want to modify, and then select Modify.  

To modify an existing style  

1. Apply the style you want to modify to a paragraph or selected text.   
2. Adjust the formatting so that the paragraph or selection looks the way you want it.   
3. Do either of the following to update the style definition with the new formatting: 1. In the Style gallery, right-click the style, and then select Update <style> to Match Selection. 2. In the Styles pane, point to the style, select the arrow that appears to the right of the style name, and then select Update <style> to Match Selection.  

1. Open the Modify Style dialog box for the style.  

2. In the Formatting area or from the Format menu, change the settings to achieve the look you want.  

![](images/b119fa39a6ef7e8f8756cebf066e0564fd4869683e7eac7ffd5a75e686502272.jpg)  
You can modify as many aspects of a style as you can of the document text  

3. To save the style modification in the template, select New documents based on this template (otherwise, the style will be modified in this document only).  

4. Select OK.  


# To create a simple style  

1. Apply the formatting that you want to include in the style to a paragraph or selection of text.  

2. On the Home tab, in the Styles group, select the More button (below the scroll arrows) and then on the menu, select Create a Style.  

A minimal version of the Create New Style From Formatting dialog box opens.  

![](images/0582a9e7fbf28806db6483509cd58666ce0cd0afac47d2054fa215935897beac.jpg)  

The Paragraph Style Preview box displays the style formatting  

3. In the Create New Style from Formatting dialog box, enter a name for the style in the Name box, and then select OK.  

To create a style that is linked to other styles  

# Tip  

To save steps later, you can insert the cursor in the style you want to base the new style on, and then apply the formatting that you want to that style.  

1. Do either of the following to open the full version of the Create New Style From Formatting dialog box: 1. In the lower-left corner of the Styles pane, select the New Style button. 2. Open the minimal version of the dialog box, and then select Modify.  

![](images/735dd3cc21074cd620fd4125c84e53d739f8b50f9c98f9457eb828826318e43e.jpg)  

Basing a style on another simplifies global updates  

2. Do the following:  

0. In the Name box, insert a name for the style.  

1. In the Style based on list, verify or select the style that you want to build the new style on. Updating the base style updates all styles based on it.  

3. Do either of the following:   
0. In the Formatting section, select the font, font size, font effects, font color, alignment, line spacing, space before and after, and indent.   
1. Select Format, and then from the Format list, format the font, paragraph, tabs, border, language, frame, numbering, shortcut key, or text effects.   
4. If you’re creating a paragraph style, in the Style for following paragraph list, select the style that you want to create when the user presses Enter in a paragraph of this style.   
5. If you want to include this style in the Style gallery, select the Add to the Styles gallerycheck box.   
6. If you want to automatically update the style definition whenever formatting is applied to this style in a document, select the Automatically update check box. (You probably do not want to select this because it can modify the style when you don’t want it to.)   
7. If you want to save the style as part of the currently attached document template, click New documents based on this template.   
8. Select OK.  

To add a style to the Style gallery  

In the Styles pane, do either of the following: Right-click the style, and then select Add to Style Gallery. Point to the style, select the arrow that appears, and then select Add to Style Gallery.  

![](images/aa4e3b090948bca9abbc95215d86d3039553903b072aa43af89a1ea8e3bc0269.jpg)  

You can manage a style and the content it’s applied to from the Styles pane  



# Tip  

The Delete command appears on the menu for styles that aren’t based on other styles. The Revert To command appears for styles that are based on other styles. You cannot delete a built-in style, but if you have modified it, you can revert it back to its original formatting.  

# CREATE AND MANAGE CUSTOM THEMES  

Chapter 4, “Modify the structure and appearance of text,” contains information about applying themes, changing the default theme, and changing the colors, fonts, or effect styles of a theme within an individual document.  

If you create a combination of theme elements that you would like to use with other documents, you can save the combination as a new theme. By saving the theme in the default Document Themes folder, you make the theme available in the Themes  

gallery. However, you don’t have to store custom themes in the Document Themes folder; you can store them anywhere on your hard disk, on removable media, or on a network location.  

# Tip  

The default Document Themes folder is stored within your user profile. On a default freestanding installation, the folder is located at C:\Users\<user   
name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes. In a corporate environment with managed computer configurations, the user profile folder might be located elsewhere.  

If multiple people create corporate documents for your company, you can ensure that everyone’s documents have a common look and feel by assembling a custom theme and making it available to everyone. Use theme elements that reflect your corporate colors, fonts, and visual style, and then save the theme to a central location or send the theme file by email and instruct your colleagues to save it to the default Document Themes folder.  

# To save a custom theme  

1. Apply a base theme, and then modify the theme colors, fonts, and effects the way you want them.   
2. On the Design tab, in the Document Formatting group, select Themes.   
3. At the bottom of the Themes menu, select Save Current Theme to display the contents of the Document Themes folder in the Save Current Theme dialog box.   
4. In the File name box, replace the suggested name, and then select Save.  

# To apply a custom theme  

1. Display the Themes menu. If custom themes are saved in the Document Themes folder, the Themes menu includes a Custom section that contains those themes.   
2. In the Custom section of the Themes menu, select the theme.  

To apply a theme from a nonstandard location  

1. On the Design tab, in the Document Formatting group, select Themes. 2. At the bottom of the Themes menu, select Browse for Themes. 3. In the Choose Theme or Themed Document dialog box, browse to the theme you want to apply, and then select Open.  

To find the location of your Document Themes folder  

1. On the Design tab, in the Document Formatting group, select Themes. 2. At the bottom of the Themes menu, select Save Current Theme. 3. In the Save Current Theme dialog box, select the folder icon at the left end of the address bar to display the full path to the Document Themes folder.  

To delete a custom theme  

Open File Explorer, browse to the Document Themes folder, and delete the theme file.  

 In Word, display the Themes menu, right-click the custom theme, and then select Delete.  

Note that the second method removes the theme choice from the gallery but does not remove the theme file from your Themes folder.  

# CREATE AND ATTACH TEMPLATES  

Although most Word users rarely need to concern themselves with this fact, all Word documents are based on templates. New blank documents are based on the built-in Normal template, which defines paragraph styles for regular text paragraphs, a title, and different levels of headings. It also defines a few character styles that you can use to change the look of selected text. These styles appear in the Styles pane and are also available in the Style gallery on the Home tab. You can apply these template styles to format the content in the document.  


# Tip  

In earlier versions of Office, the default location for user templates was a hidden folder stored at C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates. Word 2016 and Word 2019 allow you to specify your own Personal Templates folder from the Save page of the Word Options dialog box. If you create a lot of your own templates, you can organize them by storing them in subfolders of your personal templates folder. You can create subfolders either by browsing to your personal templates folder in File Explorer and selecting New Folder, or by selecting New Folder in the Save As dialog box.  

If you’re working with an existing document and want to convert it to your custom template, you can either attach the custom template to the existing document or create a new document based on the custom template and import or paste in the content of the existing document. You attach a template by using the Document Template command, which is located in the Templates group on the hidden Developer tab.  

# Tip  

You can load additional templates as global templates to make their contents available in all documents that you work on. Two global templates are automatically loaded by Word—the Normal template and the Building Blocks template—but you can load others. For example, your organization might have a Custom Building Blocks template containing corporatethemed document parts that it wants you to use in all documents.  

If you modify the Normal template, you can easily revert to the original by closing all open Word documents, deleting the Normal.dotx template file from the default template location, and then restarting Word. If Word doesn’t find the Normal template, it automatically creates a new one for you with the default settings.  

# To save a document as a personal template  

1. In the Backstage view, select the Save As page tab.   
2. In the left pane of the Save As page, select the Browse button to open the Save As dialog box.   
3. In the Save as type list, select Word Template. The folder path in the Address bar changes to display your default personal templates folder.   
4. In the File name box, enter a name for the template, such as Company Fax Template. Then select Save.   
5. Close the template. It is now available from the Personal view of the New page of the Backstage view.  

# To create a document based on a personal template  

1. On the New page of the Backstage view, below the search box, Featured and Personal appear above the thumbnails if custom templates are saved in the default personal templates location. Select Personal to display the contents of your personal templates folder.   
2. In the Personal templates view, select a thumbnail. Word creates a new document based on your custom template.  

# To replace the styles attached to content  

 In the Styles pane, point to the old style name, select the arrow that appears, and select Select All. Then select the new style name.  

To load a global template and make it available for use  

1. Open the Templates and Add-ins dialog box.   
2. On the Templates page, in the Global templates and add-ins section, select Add to open the Add Template dialog box.   
3. In the Add Template dialog box, navigate to the template you want to load, and then double-click it to enter the template name in the Global Templates And Add-Ins pane. A check mark indicates that the template is active.   
4. In the Templates and Add-ins dialog box, select OK.  

# Tip  

You can deactivate a global template (but keep it available for future use) by clearing its check box, and you can unload it by selecting it in the list and selecting Remove.  

# CREATE CUSTOM BUILDING BLOCKS  

A building block is a document element that is saved in the Building Blocks global template. A building block can be as straightforward as a single word or as complicated as a page full of formatted elements. Many building blocks are provided with Word 2019, including professionally designed page elements such as cover pages, headers and footers, and sidebars; and content elements such as bibliographies, common equations, Quick Tables, and watermarks. You can use these building blocks to assemble or enhance a document.  

![](images/a0f54ba641ae7c2663cef9918259ac40ba3ac12761f35e4b4a03ada43876158e.jpg)

Custom building blocks, such as a company name and address block, make it easy to insert specific text and objects in any document  

You need to create the element exactly as you want it only one time; then you can save it as a building block and use it confidently wherever you need it. You insert a custom building block into a document from the Quick Parts gallery on the Quick Parts menu.  

![](images/6aa30684ca683acc5489a2aabd95d575d1a566c8fd1fd0e48ae352adca48ebaa.jpg)  

The building blocks in the Quick Parts gallery reflect the color scheme of the current document  

# Tip  

The Quick Parts gallery displays only the building blocks you create. The built-in building blocks are available from other galleries, such as the Cover Page gallery.  


# Tip  

To save changes to a custom building block, modify the building block in the document and then save it to the Quick Parts gallery with the same name as the original, and then select Yes when Word prompts you to indicate whether you want to redefine the building block.  

# To insert a custom building block in a document  

Position the cursor in the document where you want to insert a building block. Then do any of the following: In the Quick Parts gallery, select a building block. In the Quick Parts gallery, select Building Blocks Organizer, and then, in the Building Blocks Organizer dialog box, select the building block and then Insert. In the document, enter the name of the building block, and then press $\mathbf{F3}$ to replace the building block name with the building block. The building block picks up the formatting information from the document into which you insert it.  

1. Position the cursor anywhere in the document.  

2. In the Quick Parts gallery, right-click a building block, and then select one of the specified locations.

You can insert a custom building block by selecting a location from a list  

# To delete a custom building block  

 In the Building Blocks Organizer dialog box, select a building block, select Delete, and then select Yes when Word prompts you to indicate whether you want to delete the selected building block.  

# KEY POINTS  

 Colors, fonts, and effects can be combined into a custom theme to consistently create the look you want. You can easily create styles that draw on thematic elements to format characters and paragraphs. You can create styles and templates to speed up the work of formatting a document and ensure that formatting is consistent within and between documents. If you frequently use the same text snippets or pages in your documents, you don’t have to enter and proof it each time. Instead, save the text as a building block in your document template, insert it where you need it, and customize it as necessary.

# CHANGE DEFAULT WORD OPTIONS  

Many of the options available in the Word Options dialog box are discussed in context in other chapters in this book. This topic includes information about all the available options, including a few that power users of Word might particularly find useful to modify.  

The options discussed in this topic are available in the Word Options dialog box, which you open from the Backstage view. Each Office app has its own Options dialog box. Because so many options are available for each app and for Office, they are divided among pages (and in some cases, additional dialog boxes that you open from the pages). The pages are represented by page tabs in the left pane of the Word Options dialog box.  

![](images/3c1f03dcf422fc40a73de7d68a82e363f1196b6203bd8ac4d0dc255be225ace6.jpg)  

Shading indicates the active page tab  

The left pane of the Word Options dialog box is divided into three sections:  

The first section contains the General, Display, Proofing, Save, Language, Ease of Access, and Advanced page tabs. These are the pages of options that standard Word users will most commonly make changes to when customizing the app functionality.   
The second section contains the Customize Ribbon and Quick Access Toolbar page tabs. These are the pages on which you customize the presentation of commands in the user interface.   
The third section contains the Add-ins and Trust Center page tabs. These pages are access points for higher-level customizations that can affect the security of your computer, and are not often necessary to modify.  

# Tip  

This topic discusses the options on the General, Display, Proofing, Save, Language, Ease of Access, and Advanced pages. For information about customizing the ribbon, Quick Access Toolbar, add-ins, and security options, see the related topics later in this chapter.  

A brief description of the page content appears at the top of each page. Each page is further divided into sections of related options. The General page contains information that is shared among the Office apps. Other pages contain options that are specific to the app or to the file you’re working in.  

The images in this topic depict the default selections for each option. Many options have only On/Off settings as indicated by a selected or cleared check box. Options with settings other than On or Off are described in the content that follows the image.  

# Manage general Office and Word options  

Options that affect the user interface and startup behavior of Word are available from the General page of the Word Options dialog box.  

![](images/2d3e8e9ee919d7bf350bf0fc7cb2bad686f768bd2b48011f1e702d948264984c.jpg)  

Options for all Office apps  

The options in the first four sections of the General page are shared among the Office apps installed on the computer you’re working on, and include the following:  

 When using multiple displays, you can choose whether to optimize for best appearance or for compatibility. You can turn off the Mini Toolbar, which hosts common formatting commands and appears by default when you select content.  

 You can turn off the Live Preview feature if you find it distracting to have content formatting change when the pointer passes over a formatting command. You can minimize or turn off the display of ScreenTips when you point to buttons. You can specify the user name and initials you want to accompany your comments and tracked changes, and override the display of information from the account associated with your installation of Office.   
 You can choose the background graphics (Office background) and color scheme (Office theme) for the Office app windows.  

# Tip  

You can also set the Office background and theme on the Account page of the Backstage view. For information about Office backgrounds and themes, see “Manage Office and app settings” in Chapter 1, “Word 2019 basics.”  

If you have an Office 365 subscription, you can turn on Office intelligent services. Intelligent services help you to create the best possible content by interacting behind the scenes with online databases of content and ideas. The intelligent services available in Word include Editor, Smart Lookup, Translator, automatic alt text, and the fan favorite, dictation. (Other Office intelligent services include PowerPoint Designer, PowerPoint QuickStarter, and Excel Ideas.) Turning on Office intelligent services in any Office app turns them on for all Office apps. If you have a LinkedIn account, you can turn on LinkedIn features. In Word, this gives you access to the Résumé Assistant. (LinkedIn features also include profile cards in Outlook, SharePoint, and OneDrive for Business.)  

![](images/85a7a2084c3e6f62361b9877739f95f0010b7c2e00e437f330c8ebf531ca02bf.jpg)  

General options for Word  

The last two sections of options on the General page of the Word Options dialog box are specific to Word:  

The Start Up Options section contains options related to setting Word as the default document editor, and a couple of options that you might want to configure: to open documents in Reading view if you can’t edit them, and to turn off the Home page (also called the Start screen) that appears when you start Word without opening a specific file. When the Home page is turned off, starting the app without opening a specific file automatically creates a new, blank file.  

The Real-time Collaboration Options section allows you to turn on or off the display of names on presence flags within Word when you’re coauthoring a document.

To change the user identification that appears in comments and tracked changes  


# Manage display options  

Options on the Display page control what is shown in the content pane and how documents are printed. The default settings on this page are appropriate for most types of documents. You can turn on and off the display of formatting marks from within the app window, and set many of the printing options when you print a document.  

![](images/55ba65780b46f05b3e61321c3bc57e78386d59d1dc776be37cc90b8008042273.jpg)  

Options for displaying document content  

# Manage proofing options  

Options that affect the spelling and grammar-checking and automatic text replacement functions of Word are available from the Proofing page of the Word Options dialog box.  

![](images/de57b961502f01c285bef95bb382333e37a8db6e92306f5ca0ca2c9c8ede7859.jpg)  
Editorial options for working with document content  

You might find that you want to modify the spelling and grammar correction options in the When Correcting Spelling And Grammar In Word section of the page. These options control whether Word automatically checks for spelling errors, grammar errors, and writing style issues. When automatic checking is turned on, Word displays red wavy lines under words it thinks are spelled wrong, blue double lines under words that don’t meet its grammar guidelines, and gold dotted lines under words or phrases that could be rephrased for clarity or conciseness. If you find those lines distracting, you can turn off the automatic checking, modify the grammar and style issues Word checks for, or turn off the display of the lines for the current document (or for all documents).  

When reviewing spelling in a document, you have options to ignore one or all instances of suspected spelling errors. You choose to ignore all instances of a flagged spelling error in a document either from the shortcut menu or from the Spelling pane. Word remembers your selection and removes the squiggly underlines from all instances of that word. If you want Word to forget those settings and conduct a fresh spelling check, you can do that from this page.  


# Manage file saving options  

The Save page of the Word Options dialog box contains two sections of options that control the behavior of the app, and one section that is specific to the document you’re working in.  

Options that affect where and when Word saves and looks for documents and templates are available in the Save Documents and Offline Editing Options sections. These options can be rather important—not necessarily to change them, but to know where Word stores files so that you can browse to them if necessary.  

![](images/1e59664cca2eaae497947fcdb74068f0af43571eb70cb1b41ecd72f2410b9b6f.jpg)  

Customize your save options  

Three options that you might find useful include:  

AutoSave OneDrive and SharePoint Online files by default on Word If you’re working on a file that you’ve opened from OneDrive or a SharePoint site, you can turn this option on so that Word automatically saves changes as you make them.  

# Tip  

If you open a file in Word from SharePoint and don’t make any changes, the SharePoint site will still display your name as having made recent changes.  

Save AutoRecover Information If you’re making a lot of changes that you don’t want to lose, or feel that your system might run into trouble (for example, if you’re in a location that experiences frequent power outages and you don’t have battery backup), you can automatically save drafts more frequently than the default of every 10 minutes.  

Default Local File Location You can specify the folder that Word displays in the Save As dialog box when you select This PC in the Other Locations list. The default is your Documents folder, but if you routinely save in another location, you can save yourself a few steps by choosing that instead. (Or you can add the location to the Other Locations list.)  

The location specified in the Offline Editing section is where Word stores local copies of online files it’s working with. It’s best to not change anything in this section.  

Options for saving fonts with the current document are available in the Preserve Fidelity section. When you distribute a Word document electronically (as a .docx file), the fonts in the document render correctly on-screen only if they are installed on the computer that’s displaying the document. If you use fonts in your document other than those that come with Office, or if you have reason to believe that the fonts you use won’t be available on a computer or device that displays the document, you can embed the fonts in the document.  

![](images/d0ae271bfb4c181dce27e7bd62b971cc7b09e56da60b9a6e5a22392297a3624a.jpg)  
Embed nonstandard fonts in documents so they display correctly on other computers  

Embedding fonts in a document increases the size of the file. You can minimize the increase by embedding only the characters that are used in the document. Letters, numbers, and symbols that aren’t in the document when you embed the fonts will not be available. Embedding all the characters of a font requires more storage space, especially if you use multiple fonts in the document, but makes the characters available on other systems so the document content can be gracefully edited.  

To turn off the AutoSave feature when working with online files  

 Clear the AutoSave OneDrive and SharePoint Online files by default on Wordcheck box.   
 On the Quick Access Toolbar, toggle AutoSave to Off.  

To change the automatic draft saving frequency  

1. Display the Save page of the Word Options dialog box. 2. In the Save documents section, set the saving frequency in the Save AutoRecover information every box.  

To change the default local folder  

1. Start File Explorer and browse to the folder you want to set as the default.   
2. Do either of the following to copy the folder path to the Clipboard: 1. Select the folder icon at the left end of the Address box to display the folder path. Then press $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{C}$ . 2. Right-click the Address box, and then select Copy address as text.   
3. Display the Save page of the Word Options dialog box.  

4. In the Save documents section, select the content of the Default local file   
locationbox.   
5. Do either of the following to paste the folder path into the box:   
0. Press $\mathbf{Ctrl}{+}\mathbf{V}$ .   
1. Right-click the selection, and then select Paste.  

To embed fonts in a document  

1. Display the Save page of the Word Options dialog box.   
2. In the Preserve fidelity when sharing this document section, select the Embed fonts in the file check box.   
3. If you don’t want to embed the entire character set of all fonts used in the document, select Embed only the characters used in the document (best for reducing file size) check box.  

Additional fidelity-related options are located in the Preserve Fidelity When Sharing This Document section of the Advanced page of the Word Options dialog box. For information about those settings, see “Manage advanced options” later in this topic.  

# Manage language options  

Most people use only one editing and display language when working in documents, but people who work or collaborate in a multilingual environment use additional languages. The Language page of the Word Options dialog box contains options for adding, removing, and prioritizing language options in all the installed Office apps.  

![](images/210aaa7bf481065e4157322ae11403066847f6064ee639606f6b051637e24ab5.jpg)  

You can install additional language packs  

You can configure two types of language options on the Language page:  

· Editing languages, which control the keyboard and proofing settings Display languages, which control the language of user interface labels (such as ribbon tab names and button names) and built-in user assistance features (such as ScreenTips)  

The keyboard languages are installed through Windows, but you can start the process from this page. If you’ve already installed a language on your computer through Windows, that language is automatically available to you in Office as a keyboard language. The Office proofing tools and display languages are specific to Office and aren’t provided by Windows.  

# To add an editing language to Office

![](images/1d7c1c745439bcbbde8707aae7c3da73f2eccd7d2b8fbbce3a89ac76840ef877.jpg)  

The options in the Editing Options and Cut, Copy, And Paste sections are selfexplanatory, other than the Use Smart Cut And Paste option. This option is very useful when working with text in a Word document because it controls whether the app tries to merge content into adjacent lists when you cut it from one location and paste it in another.  

![](images/fc7656bbd35c4360d433606ea6c24a00866e49519aa8ad7c1ed047b2040e9bb3.jpg)  

# Manage the ways Word pastes content  

Most of the options in the Image Size And Quality and Chart sections are specific to the current document. These options can frequently be useful:  

Discard editing data When you insert images in a document and then edit them by using the tools on the Format tool tab for pictures, Word saves the editing data so you can undo your changes. You can decrease the file size of a document by discarding the editing data. Do not compress images in file When you’re finalizing a document for distribution, you have the option to compress the media within the file. This results in a smaller file size but also a lower quality. You also have the option to exclude images from the media compression.  

The option in the Chart section controls whether custom data labels and formatting stay with data points in charts. It seems likely that this would always be the better option, but if you find that it presents a problem, you can turn it off here.  

![](images/e2a680e8d7b268262b3bd059c4915a647f6ef3a1f7d4f3ae715d8d5778a05fea.jpg)  
Manage the impact of images on file size  

Options in the Display section are among those that you might want to configure for the way you work. You can change the number of documents that appear in the Recent file list in the right pane of the Open page of the Backstage view.  

![](images/af41817f501275d46b1fe571ab82714f1e3b9654b16c61ab89ee37d3350e3928.jpg)  
Configure the display of information in the Backstage view and in the app window  

You can also display your most recently edited documents directly in the left pane of the Backstage view, below the Options button, for easy access. This can be very convenient, but the option is not turned on by default.  

![](images/80ffd7f33294684583be51a3ff87634d02c06ca80eb69615390e35d6d2121086.jpg)  

# Quickly access recent documents from the left pane of the Backstage view  

You configure the display of ScreenTips and whether they include feature descriptions on the General page of the Word Options dialog box. However, the option to display keyboard shortcuts within ScreenTips is here in the Display section of the Advanced page. If you like to work from the keyboard and don’t have the full list of keyboard shortcuts memorized, you can learn them by including them in ScreenTips.  

![](images/d6aecd5cfdc439c946aae2b60ac314d386ad4960c01185f841e0c9c15fc589ac.jpg)  


# Advanced options related to saving documents  

Additional fidelity-related options are located in the Preserve Fidelity When Sharing This Document section of the Save page of the Word Options dialog box. For information about those settings, see “Manage file saving options” earlier in this topic.  

The General section of the Advanced page includes options that don’t fit elsewhere. One item of note here is the Mailing Address box. If you enter your name and address  

in this box, Word automatically fills it in for you when you create envelopes and mailing labels.  

![](images/46b4b04cf0a746e459c02a21469c839a56b8e609c5873d722b16ead48c6d6276.jpg)  

Provide your address to Word for use in mail merge documents  


# CUSTOMIZE THE QUICK ACCESS TOOLBAR  

By default, buttons representing the Save, Undo, and Redo commands appear on the Quick Access Toolbar. If you regularly use a few commands that are scattered on various tabs of the ribbon and you don’t want to switch between tabs to access the commands, you might want to add them to the Quick Access Toolbar so that they’re always available to you.  

You can add commands to the Quick Access Toolbar directly from the ribbon, or from the Quick Access Toolbar page of the Word Options dialog box.  

# Tip  

You can display a list of commands that do not appear on the ribbon by selecting Commands Not In The Ribbon in the Choose Commands From list on the Quick Access Toolbar or the Customize Ribbon page of the app-specific Options dialog box.  

![](images/19dfb13061d72f7e2f21c7ab41d8bc4053e361ab6dd1b2a8d8287dece97aa7e0.jpg)  

The Quick Access Toolbar is a convenient command organization option  

You can customize the Quick Access Toolbar in the following ways:  

 You can define a custom Quick Access Toolbar for all documents (referred to in the Word Options dialog box as documents), or you can define a custom Quick Access Toolbar for a specific document. You can add any command from any group of any tab, including tool tabs, to the toolbar.   
 You can display a separator between different types of buttons.   
 You can move commands around on the toolbar until they are in the order you want. You can reset everything back to the default Quick Access Toolbar configuration.  

After you add commands to the Quick Access Toolbar, you can reorganize them and divide them into groups to simplify the process of locating the command you want.  

As you add commands to the Quick Access Toolbar, it expands to accommodate them. If you add a lot of commands, it might become difficult to view the text in the title bar, or all the commands on the Quick Access Toolbar might not be visible, defeating the purpose of adding them. To resolve this problem and also position the Quick Access Toolbar closer to the file content, you can move the Quick Access Toolbar below the ribbon.  

# To add a command to the Quick Access Toolbar from the ribbon  

Right-click a command on the ribbon, and then select Add to Quick Access Toolbar. You can add any type of command this way; you can even add a drop-down list of options or gallery of thumbnails.  

![](images/b174705b29a3d7b36b63c4a79c23d73e909ea4b57c878bed23b59e8e501c9be5.jpg)

# CUSTOMIZE THE RIBBON  

The ribbon was designed to make all the commonly used commands visible so that people can more easily discover the full potential of each Office app. But many people perform the same set of tasks all the time, and for them, buttons that they never use might be considered just another form of clutter.  

If you don’t want to entirely hide the ribbon, you can modify its content. From the Customize Ribbon page of the Word Options dialog box, you can control the tabs that appear on the ribbon, and the groups that appear on the tabs.  

![](images/502c00aad52dc887e2559fa70bb315bfc6e7f781c56ba773a825b9d472f06e4f.jpg)  

# You can hide and display individual ribbon tabs  

On this page, you can customize the ribbon in the following ways:  

 You can hide an entire tab. You can remove a group of commands from a tab. (The group is not removed from the app, only from the tab.) You can move or copy a group of commands to another tab. You can create a custom group on any tab and then add commands to it. (You cannot add commands to a predefined group.) You can create a custom tab. For example, you might want to do this if you use only a few commands from each tab and you find it inefficient to flip between them.  

Don’t be afraid to experiment with the ribbon to come up with the configuration that best suits the way you work. If at any point you find that your new ribbon is harder to work with rather than easier, you can easily reset everything back to the default configuration.

# MANAGE ADD-INS AND SECURITY OPTIONS  

The final section of pages in the Word Options dialog box contains the settings that you should definitely think carefully about before changing, because they can affect the security of your system.  

# Manage add-ins  

Add-ins are utilities that add specialized functionality to a program but aren’t fullfledged programs themselves. Word includes two primary types of add-ins: COM add-ins (which use the Component Object Model) and Word add-ins.  

There are several sources of add-ins:  

You can purchase add-ins from third-party vendors; for example, you can purchase an add-in that allows you to assign keyboard shortcuts to Word commands that don’t already have them.  You can download free add-ins from the Microsoft website or other websites.  

Third-party applications such as Adobe Acrobat and Intuit Quickbooks might install add-ins so you can interact with them from within Microsoft Office 2019 programs.  

# Tip  

Be careful when downloading add-ins from websites other than those you know and trust. Add-ins are executable files that can easily be used to spread viruses and otherwise wreak havoc on your computer. For this reason, the Microsoft Office Trust Center might disable the installation of add-ins or require your permission to install or run them.  

You can locate information about the add-ins on your computer and manage the addins from the Add-ins page of the Word Options dialog box.  

View andmanageMicrosoft Office Add-ins.  

![](images/5a4d29fff033c5a6ddb1281671dc6b774a39f0599234ce25948b35044115fff8.jpg)  

Each type of add-in has its own management interface. You can add and remove addins, turn off installed add-ins, and enable add-ins that have been disabled.  

![](images/c8bb264282cfddeb3c94d896c73c0069ca576ae2ec8014481ead8b4e1ab11f33.jpg)  

Display and manage active and disabled add-ins  

Many add-ins install themselves, but to use some add-ins, you must first install them on your computer and then load them into your computer’s memory.  


# To install an add-in  

1. Display the dialog box for the type of add-in you want to manage.   
2. In the dialog box, select Add or Add New.   
3. In the Add Add-In dialog box, navigate to the folder where the add-in you want to install is stored, and double-click its name.   
4. In the list of available add-ins in the Add-In dialog box, select the check box of the new add-in, and then select OK or Load to make the add-in available for use in Word.  

# Configure Trust Center options  

The Trust Center is a separate multipage dialog box in which you can configure security and privacy settings. You open the Trust Center from the Trust Center page of the Word Options dialog box. The Trust Center settings aren’t exposed directly on the page; you must select a button next to a warning recommending that you not change any of the settings.  

![](images/ce26dfb9f280029727c1cf23c6c57aa09a3b1bde2874ac1aa3c46a7ea027a98b.jpg)  

# You can configure security and privacy settings in the Trust Center  

If you don’t take care when modifying the Trust Center settings, you could expose Word, your computer, and your network to malicious software. Depending on the type of files you work with and the breadth of your work network, you might find it appropriate to modify some of these settings in Word. Review the available settings so you can evaluate whether any of them would be appropriate to change in your specific situation.  

The Trust Center has 11 pages of options that you can configure. When you first open the Trust Center from the Backstage view, the Macro Settings page is active. As in the Word Options dialog box, you select a page tab name in the left pane to display that page in the right pane.  

![](images/3b05a80458c1e691286137ffad40e6ce659b1ddeccad5ba17f5a6265b0a202e1.jpg)  

It is safest to run macros only from trusted sources  

Most pages display options that are very specific to the page name. When you’re working in Word, some circumstances will send you directly to this dialog box—for example, if you open a document that contains macros, and then select the info bar to enable them, Word takes you to this page.  

Many of the Trust Center options are beyond the scope of any needs that you’d usually have when creating documents. Some options that might be of interest are those that make it easier to work in documents that you trust, but that Word might not know are safe.  

When you open a document from an online location (such as a cloud storage location or email message) or from a location that has been deemed unsafe, Word opens the file in Protected View, with most editing functions disabled. This prevents any malicious code embedded in the file from gaining access to your computer. If you’re uncertain about the origin of a file that you’re opening, you can choose to open the file in Protected View.  

In Protected View, the title bar displays Read-Only in brackets to the right of the file name, and a yellow banner at the top of the content pane provides information about why the file has been opened in Protected View. If you know that the document is from a safe location or sender, and you want to edit the file content, you can choose to enable editing.  

If you frequently need to edit documents that open in Protected View, you can modify options on three pages of the Trust Center to affect this:  

If you want to open a document from a specific storage location without going into Protected View, you can add that folder (and its subfolders, if you want) to your Trusted Locations list.  

![](images/1a056c7e89a0473c6adf7d4a63e804fcce6c6c4a085a7ef0e24fd17fde9fec3c.jpg)  
Trust the contents of specific storage folders  

If you want to trust folders on other computers on your network, you must first specifically choose that option. Otherwise, when you try to add a network folder as a trusted location, the Trust Center displays a message that it is not permitted by your current security settings. Before selecting the option to allow network locations, consider who or what has access to the network locations you intend to allow, and whether the locations are secure or could host malicious content.  

If you want to be able to edit all files of a specific type (based on the file extension) you can modify the File Block settings.  

![](images/d3409a5f7e8fe988df5a38d5e15452d23151dfab62ee98236a5166eaee18e2de.jpg)  

# Block specific file types or permit editing in Protected View  

 You can exclude an entire class of files (files originating from the internet, stored in unsafe locations, or received as email attachments) from Protected View.  

![](images/d0467836a11906f72aab62e9eeb49d3c2794be07daf40ae44a35f71e8e895a50.jpg)  

Turn off Protected View for a class of files  

Before doing any of these things, you should carefully consider whether the “rule” you’re making will always yield the results you want.  

If you frequently work with a specific Word document that contains active content, and you feel that the security prompts are unnecessarily slowing you down, you can choose to trust the document. When you do so, it is added to the Trusted Documents list. You can manage the Trusted Documents list from the Trusted Documents page of the Trust Center. You can stipulate whether to trust documents that aren’t stored locally, turn off the Trusted Documents function completely (to stop trusting all documents), or clear the Trusted Documents list to start over.  

![](images/8f5cd76c457e18e79ef1f4183ed720a04af511e839de655ce2408bb1007dd7b5.jpg)  
If you experience trouble with a trusted document, you can reset the list here  

If you track changes and insert comments in documents, you might run into this surprising behavior—Word changing your user information to “Author” when you save the document. To correct that problem, clear the Remove Personal Information From File Properties On Save check box in the Document-specific Settings section of the Privacy Options page.  

![](images/a0665a01231c5907daf445f13f1e1f7c4e192b8ad46256324e1a03db821dc21a.jpg)  
Privacy options are important to manage if you use the collaboration features  

From the Research & Reference section of this page, you can configure translation options and manage the reference books and research sites available in Word.  

![](images/2047b37938fab16951b9320ec84292ac5017a4eb410d8026e525f1713b8eb4fb.jpg)  
Add reference services to your available resources  

Some, but not all, of the Trust Center pages include buttons that you can select to reset that set of options to the defaults, so take care when making changes; if you’re uncertain whether you should invoke a change, select Cancel to close the Trust Center without committing to the changes.  

As with options in the Word Options dialog box, you should take the time to familiarize yourself with the Trust Center settings so you know what changes are possible to make, in the event that it is appropriate to do so in your computing environment.  

# To open the Trust Center  

1. Open the Word Options dialog box.   
2. In the left pane, select the Trust Center page tab.   
3. On the Trust Center page, select the Trust Center Settings button. To stop Word from attributing your comments to Author when you save files   
1. Open the Trust Center and display the Privacy Options page.   
2. In the Document-specific settings section of the Privacy Options page, clear the Remove personal information from file properties on save check box.  

# KEY POINTS  

 Most of the settings that control the Word environment are available from the pages of the Word Options dialog box. From this dialog box, you also have access to security and privacy settings. You can have one-click access to almost any Word 2019 command by adding a button for it to the Quick Access Toolbar. You can customize the Quick Access Toolbar for all documents or for a specific document or template.

# CREATE CUSTOM KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS  

If a command you use frequently doesn’t have a built-in keyboard shortcut, or if you don’t like the keyboard shortcut assigned to the command, you can create one either in a specific document or in a template. You can also modify the built-in keyboard shortcuts.  

To manage keyboard shortcuts  

1. Display the Customize Ribbon page of the Word Options dialog box. 2. Below the Choose commands from pane, to the right of Keyboard shortcuts, select the Customize button. 3. In the Customize Keyboard dialog box, select the category containing the command for which you want to create a keyboard shortcut, and then select the command. The Current Keys box displays any keyboard shortcut already assigned to the command. 4. Position the cursor in the Press new shortcut key box, and then press the key combination you want to use as a keyboard shortcut for the selected command. In the area below the Current Keys box, Word tells you whether the keyboard shortcut is currently assigned to a command or unassigned. 5. To delete an existing keyboard shortcut to make it available for reassignment, select it in the Current keys box, and then select the Remove button. 6. To assign an available keyboard shortcut to the selected command, do either o the following:   
1. To save the keyboard shortcut in all documents based on the current template,   
verify that the template name is selected in the Save changes in list, and then elect Assign.   
2. To save the keyboard shortcut only in the current document, select the ocument name in the Save changes in list, and then select Assign. 7. To delete all custom keyboard shortcuts, select Reset All. 8. Close the Customize Keyboard dialog box and the Word Options dialog box.
